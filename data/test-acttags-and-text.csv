"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
b^m,Okay.
qw,"Well what do you think about the idea of, uh, kids having to do public service work for a year?"
qy,"Do you think it's a <breathing>, -"
sv,"Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea."
sv,"I think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people."
aa,"Yes,"
aa,"yes,"
%,"def-, -"
sv,"I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help"
sv,"and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home"
sv,and --
aa,That's true.
+,-- I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
sv,"and, or the military for a year or two,"
b,Yeah.
+,"wouldn't be bad for, -"
sv,I think it teaches kids how to grow.
qo,How about yourself?
aa,"Uh, I agree with you."
sd,"Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back <breathing>, well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of, i-, i-, -"
sv,"you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts <children> or Girl Scouts"
sv,"and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,"
sv,"but these days they're not, uh,"
sv,"par-, parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that."
sd,"Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part o-, of, of the scouting, and, you know. -"
b,"Yeah,"
%,"I've, I've, -"
sv,that's really great.
sv,"I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations."
aa,They are
%,"but parents, -"
sv,"You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,"
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,they do.
sv,"and they don't follow it at all, you know."
sv,"There are very few Scouts go on,"
aa,"Oh, no."
+,and become Eagle Scouts.
sd,"And, and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals"
%,"but, -"

sd,senior.
b,Oh.
b^m,"Senior,"
bk,okay.
%,"So, there's not, uh, -"
%,"Oh, they're just not, -"
sv,"once they get into junior high it just,"
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"they, they lose interest."
+,not done anymore <children>.
sv,"and then when they young, young adults,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,there's even less interest there.
sv,"They're more for, I g-, -"
^2,Me <laughter>.
%,"Not, not, -"
aa,yeah.
sd,"Grab,"
sd,"grab,"
sd,"grab,"
sd,walk out <laughter>.
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,you're absolutely right <laughter>.
b,Yeah
x,<sniffing>.
sv,I think it's a really a good thing.
sd,"I, I like to see, -"
sv,"of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help <laughter>."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country,"
sv,"But I think,"
+,too.
+,we ought to start right here at home.
%,"I'm, you know, -"
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young k-, people."
aa,"No,"
%,"it, it, -"
sv,"But, since there is much that needs to be done here. -"
sv,"I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here"
sv,"and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Well, it's been really good."
sd,"We talked about this for a few minutes,"
sd,"and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,"
sd,"but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess."
b,"No,"
sd,"I, I agree with you <laughter>."
sv,"It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing,"
b,Yeah.
+,that they should do sometime.
aa,Okay.

fc,"and, and,"
fc,"You, too."

fc,"You, too."
ft,"Thank you, ma'am."
fc,Bye-bye.
fc,Bye-bye.
b,"Um,"
fp,Hi <laughter>.
sd,one thing you know that I always think about when I think of public education -
sd,"cause I went through the public, um, school system of Boston,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"and, uh, I always felt that I graduated high school"
sd,"and I still didn't even I, I couldn't put together a map of the United State."
b,Um.
qy,You know what I mean.
ny,Uh-huh.
sv,An yet I felt that I got a good education
sd,"and I, I did well in school"
sd,"but you tell me to name, you know, five continents"
sd,"an I,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,couldn't do it.
sv,"I just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education,"
b,Uh.
sv,"and the people are, are leaving school (( )) not even knowing some common sense things."
b,Yeah.
%,"One, -"
sd,"well, talking about public education, um, I'm, we're doing a proposal,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"it's, we're doing it at N C State,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum,"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,So that's kind of in a higher level <laughter>.
b,Right.
sv,So it's interesting that you chose that topic <laughter>.
b,"Yeah,"
qy,"um, did you do through a public school system or private?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"well, I went through private an until ninth grade."
bk,"Uh-huh,"
qy,did you notice a big difference?
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
sv,a big difference.
qo,Like in what sense?
sv,"Well, um, in, uh, public schools I guess there wer-, there are a lot of, of, you know, -"
sv,people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But, um, private school you couldn't do that,"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,you had to learn.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I work in a temporary agency
sd,"an they're people that come in, you know, every day to fill out an application,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"and they'll have to bring somebody with them,"
sd,"and they will show that they completed, um, four year of high school,"
sd,"yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application,"
b,Uh.
+,"they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves,"
sv,That's bad.
sv,it's just incredible.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"our State cut a whole bunch of a, I think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget."
b,Really.
sd,So they're making all kind of cuts
sv,"in college people cannot, I mean, the teachers can't make tests any more,"
sd,"and th-, the library canceling all of it's subscriptions."
b,Yeah.
sv,It's pretty sorry.
aa,"I know,"
%,"um, they, uh, -"
sd,I forget -
sv,"I think it's, um, some place in New York because they're having budget problems,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,they're closing the libraries.
sd,"I mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports,"
b,Uh.
+,"or anything like that,"
sd,they're not cutting in any other corner
sd,they're closing the libraries.
sv,"That to me shows a little, uh, switch in priorities."
b,Yeah.
%,You know.
qy,So do you go to college right now?
%,"Are yo-, -"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,it's my last year <laughter>.
qy^d,"You're a, so you're a senior now."
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,I'm working on my projects trying to graduate <laughter>.
ba,"Oh, good for you."
b,Yeah.
ba,"That's great,"
qy,"um, is, is N C University is that, uh, State, -"
sd,N C State.
br,What did you say?
sd,N C State.
b^m,"N C State,"
qy^d,that's a State University then.
ny,Yeah.
b,I see.
qy^d,And you're from there also?
ny,"Well, yeah,"
sd,"I was, uh, I was born in ((Wylie))"
sd,"and then I lived in (( )),"
b,Uh-huh.
+,most of my life.
bk,I see.
sd,And now I'm back here going to school.
sv,"Well, pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college."
b,Yeah.
sv,It's just a outrageously expensive.
sd,Luckily state <laughter> is one of the cheap ones.
qy,Oh is it.
ny,Yeah.
%,"Well, still though -"
sv,"I mean, you know, thousands of dollars, -"
sv,"Yeah, state's not that bad <laughter>."
ba,"Oh, well, that's good."
b,Yeah.
ba,That's good.
sd,I went to a private university
h,"and, um, I don't know"
sd,I look back now
sv,"and I, I think that I probably would have done it differently if I, um, you know, could do it over again."
b,Yeah.
sd,"But, um, I have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school, some, some of them,"
sv,and I still feel like they came out knowing just as much as I did.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,I really do
sv,and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say
%,"but, um, -"
b,"Yeah,"
h,"I don't know,"
%,"I,"
qw,Where did you go?
+,I -
br,what?
qw,Where did you go?
sd,I went to ((Brandice)) University.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,It's in Massachusetts.
sd,"And, um, I really felt like I've been working now for about four years,"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"and I, I feel like what I've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school."
b,Oh.
sv,"And I know that I'm drawing a lot of what I learned in school, you know,"
sv,"I, I probably just subconsciously rely a lot on, on art."
h,"But, um, I don't know"
sd,"my sister's a principal at a school,"
sd,"and one thing she's trying to instill in kids, um, besides just reading and writing are just some, the golden rules,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"she calls them just some basics about, um, you know, you don't take what's not yours,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"uh, and if you want to, you know, you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission."
sd,"Like no hitting, you know,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"no pulling hair or anything like that,"
sd,"and, uh, the school that she's in is a, um, it's basically for minorities,"
sd,"um, there's a large minority population."
sd,"And, um, she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there -"
sv,"I think they don't value that type of student as much as you get,"
b,Yeah
sv,"that's,"
+,in some.
+,sorry.
bf,"That they, that they like pick on th-, the advanced students and pay more attention to them,"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,it's true.
+,ignore the others.
b,Uh-huh.
b,Yeah.
sd,And I don't know if it makes them feel better -
%,"I mean the do teachers get, -"
sv,I mean personally I would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful.
b,Yeah.
sv,"And seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in, in areas and just watching them get better, you know."
b,Yeah.
sv,That's not much of a challenge.
aa,<Laughter> That's true.
qy,"But ar-, do you have any ideal what you're going into when you graduate."
na,"Um, graduate school <laughter>."
bh,Oh yeah.
ny,Yeah.
qy,Do you know where you're going?
na,I think I'm going to Chappel Hill.
qw,Where's that?
sd,That's in Chappel Hill <laughter>.
sd,"((That's the name)),"
qy,Oh is that North Carolina?
ny,Yeah.
bk,"Oh, okay."
qy^d,"Never heard of the, uh, Tarheels?"
nn,"No,"
sd,I don't know that area.
qy^d,"The A C C Tarheels, U N C?"
ng,I ((just don't)) know it.
b,"Oh, uh, <laughter>. -"
sd,I don't get down there very often.
sd,"They won the final four,"
b,"Oh, really,"
+,in boy's basket ball.
sd,"well the way I pick the final four was, um, by the state that had the warmest climate."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So that's how I chose all mine,"
sd,so you can tell that I really didn't have that much to do with any of it.
x,<Laughter>.
%,"But, -"
qy^d,so obviously you're into education.
ny,Yeah.
%,"If you can be going, -"
sd,"my husband went to, is in graduate school actually right now."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"And, uh, -"
h,I don't know
sd,I give you a lot of credit.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"I couldn't do it,"
sd,"I,"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I know.
+,"I couldn't wait to graduate and have,"
b,Oh.
+,it be all over.
sd,"I can't wait to graduate <laughter> either,"
aa,I know.
+,now.
sd,I've got all of this stuff due
ba,oh wow.
x,<Laughter>.
sv,Overloaded.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I kind of know what you mean.
fc,"Well, it was really nice talking to you."
fc,All right.
fc,Okay.
fc,Good luck.
fc,"All right,"
ft,thank you.
fc,"All righty,"
fc,take care.
fc,"All right,"
fc,bye.
fc,Bye-bye.
qo,So what do you think?
br,"Uh, the causes of crime?"
sv,"<Throat_clearing>. Um, I think it was imbalance of power in the United States."
sv,It's causing the lower class to rebel.
sv,"That's why there's su-, such high crime,"
sv,"and, uh, there's crime in, uh, young people because they don't have ro-, role models --"
b,Yeah.
sv,-- see too much crime on T V
sv,and they think it's the way to go.
h,I don't know.
qo,What do you think?
qw,"What about, -"
aa,"I agree with the upper and lower level, you know --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- because that's the lowest thing for themselves,"
sv,plus there's nobody for them to look up to.
b,Yeah.
sv,But I also blame some of it on parents --
b,Okay.
sv,-- because parents aren't parents.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Because I remember even when I was growing up, -"
sd,I'm thirty-five <laughter> --
b,Okay.
sd,"-- I remember when I was growing up,"
sd,"and I had friends,"
sd,"they used to do stuff like, you know, go over to a store and steal stuff."
sd,"My mother warned us, it's like, I don't care what your friends do."
sd,"If you do it, then that was it."
b,Yeah.
sd,And I knew that I would get in more trouble from my mother than from --
^2,From anybody else.
+,-- from anybody else.
sv,And I think --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- that's the basic, is they have no morals any more,"
sv,so they don't care.
b,Yeah.
%,So. -
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,I think I can agree with that too.
sd,"But now, as far as what they can do about it, I don't know."
x,<Throat_clearing>.
sv,You can't make parents be parents <laughter>.
aa,That's true.
sv,You got to kind of make people want to do the right thing.
%,You know. -
sd,I don't know how you do that.
sv,"I guess if you gave the, gave them jobs,"
sv,"that's another problem with the United States,"
sv,there's no jobs any more.
b,Yeah.
%,But. -
sd,"Well, I've heard this one theory, that if, that if a kid commits a crime, that, uh, instead of the, prosecuting the kid, they prosecute the parent."
sd,Or both of them.
sv,"That would work to a point,"
sd,"Now, to put the blame on the parent."
sv,"Well, that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway."
sv,I don't care what you do to them.
b,Yeah.
%,"You know,"
sv,"so I think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in, you know."
b,Yeah.
sv,"Because a, a, a child can get into anything regar-, -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"I don't care how good you, they are."
b,Yeah.
%,"Eventu-, at least one time, -"
sd,"but now if this is a repeated thing, -"
sd,"here with this child in juvenile, -"
%,"and or, to me, yeah, both of them. -"
b,Yeah.
sv,Because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do.
sd,"Because I just watched it on T V one night on one of them, um, Twenty Twenty, Forty-eight# hours, one of them shows# --"
b,#Uh-huh.
b,Yeah.#
+,-- where this boy had been stealing cars.
qy^d,I don't know --
b,Um.
+,-- if you seen this.
sd,"(( )) it was a little, it was a little gang of them --"
nn,"# No,"
sd,I didn't see it.#
+,"-- #stealing cars, you know,#"
b,I understand.
sd,"And then when they caught him, you know, his mother sitting there,"
^q,now they going to take me away from you.
sv,That meaned she was warned.
b,Yeah.
sv,"But see, by that, I think sometimes it's a little late."
b,Yeah.
%,"You know, -"
sv,but I'm sure there's something can be done.
b,Yeah.
qo,What about with adults?
qy^d,Anything do any about (( )) adult crime.
ny,"Yeah,"
ad,start prosecuting they
sd,but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system.
b,Yeah.
sv,"Well, for one, a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded."
sv,"Well, they should start with, the,"
sv,if they would get rid of.
sv,"Seems to me, I know there's a lot about court that people don't understand."
sv,"There's more people in jail right now for child support, okay --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- then there are for people doing drugs.
b,Um.
sv,You ought to take all them little misdemeanor people --
b,Yeah.
ad,"-- let them go,"
ad,let them go --
b,Yeah.
ad,"-- you know, give them a fine, whatever,"
ad,"make them do civic duty whatever,"
aa,"# Yeah,"
sv,"I mean seriously,#"
ad,"# Put them fools in there,#"
sv,they ought to put those (( )) people to work.
sd,"I call them all fools, idiots, whatever."
b,Yeah.
ad,"Little rock stars, put all them in there."
b,Um.
ad,"You know, the murderers, the drug dealers, the user, put them all in"
%,jail --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know,"
ad,and let all the normal people go --
b,Yeah.
%,"-- you know, because, okay, -"
qy,"if you write a bad check, you go to jail, right."
ny,<Laughter> Yeah.
ad,Let them people go.
arp_nd,Well.
sd,Not let them go and get out of it.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"they, #you still have to punish them#."
ad,#Let them go# and pay their crime or their time doing something else --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, like cleaning up the city or however they do their --"
b,"Yeah,"
%,"that's, -"
+,"-- community time, you know, whatever that is <laughter>."
sv,"But pu-, don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"and they're, they're still, they can provide for society,"
sv,whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society.
b,Uh-huh.
%,So. -
h,"I don't know,"
%,"some people, boy, they got, -"
sv,I think the United States has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else.
aa,"<Laughter> Yeah,"
sv,that's true.
sd,"Now how they going to fix it, I don't know."
sv,I don't think there is a ready solution.
aa,"No,"
sv,I don't think so either.
%,Uh. -
sv,"Because the economy is down, people, you know, the, the, the low man on the pole is getting more of the, I guess, the bulk of it."
b,Yeah.
sv,And he's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet.
sv,And they keep taking more money from us --
b,Uh-huh.
%,"-- and people are get,"
sv,and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it.
b,Yeah.
sv,"Might as well steal,"
sd,then they don't have to pay taxes on it <laughter>.
aa,That's it.
b,Yeah.
sd,"So, you know, they, I, I, I know that's bad, but, you know, just like Texas now."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,They could have had a lottery.
sd,They don't want a lottery.
qh,Why not?
sv,I would rather pay for a lottery --
%,"They'd have a, -"
+,"-- a dollar, two, three dollars, whatever I'm paying, you know --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- a week or whatever, and never see any of that money, than to have them take a portion of my paycheck."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Because, <laughter> you know, they take,"
sd,"and Uncle Sam takes his,"
sv,the Social Security which probably won't be here when I get that old --
b,Um.
+,-- you know.
sd,Because we're paying for Social Security they using now.
b,Yeah.
qw,Who's going to pay for mine?
no,I don't know <laughter>.
%,"<Laughter> But it's, it's -"
sd,I'm not counting on it.
aa,"No,"
sv,you don't count on Social Security.
b,Yeah.
%,"But, it's, it's, -"
sd,"that's what I'm saying,"
sv,they need to do something else.
b,Um.
%,But. -
sv,Crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down.
b,Yeah.
sv,And it's going to get worse.
b,Yeah.
sd,That's just like last night they killed them people in that store.
qw,Where you at?
sd,"I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina."
bk,Oh <laughter>.
sd,No wonder you don't know that.
qw,"Well, where are you from?"
sd,I'm in Dallas.
bk,Okay.
sd,"But last night, <laughter> they killed, uh, uh, four people in a chain food."
ba,"Oh, man."
sd,"And killed them, -"
sd,"well, it was two stores side by side."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"One was a store and one was like a, a fast food place,"
sd,"(( )) chicken or something, I don't know."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Anyway, they raped the women, beat them all up, including the women,"
sd,"I mean, they just beat them."
sd,Stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all.
ba,Ow.
qw,"Why was, you know, why -- -"
^2,Why did they do in the freezer?
qw,"-- you know, why didn't they just, -"
sv,"if they was going to lock them, just lock them in the freezer, take the money, you know."
b,Yeah.
sv,"They didn't have to kill them or rape them, or anything."
b,Um.
b,Um.
sv,That's awful.
%,"Yeah,"
sd,we still get some in Raleigh.
sd,"I mean, not --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- not too often real bad ones,"
%,<talking> but. -
sv,It's just getting really ridiculous down here.
sv,"I wish I could move somewhere where, this, you know, you got to like in the country."
sv,I don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes.
sv,"Well, I think, if it's, -"
sd,the town is smaller --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and everybody knows everybody --
b,Yeah.
sv,-- it's harder --
b,Yeah.
+,-- to come in there and do something.
%,"Where is, -"
sv,"and, and, and see that's another thing."
sv,Neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more.
b,Yeah.
sv,"There's nobody is next door to you,"
sv,"you don't know your neighbors, and stuff like that."
b,Yeah.
%,"It's just, huh-uh, <laughter> you know, -"
sd,because I moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers.
b,Um.
%,"And you didn't even, -"
sd,"and what the manager, the manager won't even do anything."
sv,He's probably a drug dealer himself <laughter>.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,You never know.
aa,You don't.
sd,"And so I moved,"
sd,because I moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up --
ba,Wow.
+,"-- you know,"
sd,and this is like across the street.
sd,This was a nice part of town --
b,Um.
sd,"-- and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that, making that, um, crack stuff --"
b,Um.
sd,"-- and then, the other time I saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner."
sd,"I say, See, this is it."
bf,Time to go.
aa,"That's it,"
sd,and I moved.
b,Yeah.
sd,"And, you know, now I live in like a fam-, a neighborhood in a town house,"
sv,but it's nice.
h,"# I don't, you know.#"
b,# Yeah.
sd,"I'm kind of# in the same, same kind of deal, town house in a neighborhood."
%,"But, -"
sv,It's pretty nice.
sv,"I don't know how they can live, a neighborhood or apartment complex."
sv,"That's what happen, that's what wrong,"
x,<Throat_clearing>.
+,you know.

b,Yeah.

b,Oh yeah.

qy,Huh. Well are you going to paint the outside of your house too?

bh,Oh really?

sd,but --
b,Yeah.

sd,other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional.
sd,"Well, our house in New Mexico, it was stucco,"
sd,"but we had all this trim to paint, and lots of it."
b,Yeah.
sd,And we did basically seventy-five percent of the house
sd,and then I was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff.
b,Uh-huh.

b,Yeah.

sd,and he knew that <laughter>.

aa,Yeah.
+,-- for that.
sd,"Plus, he cleaned up my mess."
sd,"<Laughter> Oh, I think that is what we might have to do with this chimney,"
sd,"but other than that, it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself."
b,Uh-huh.

qw,# How much # did it cost you for the paint for the outside?

b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.

sd,and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- so she had to start all over again --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and when he got outside, he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something."
ba,"Oh, my word."
sd,And he saw (( )) . -
bf,So that was really worth it. # Painting his own house. #
aa,"# Yeah,"
sd,# it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff.
ba,"Oh, my word <laughter>."
x,<Laughter>.
ba,"Oh, my word."

b,<Laughter> Yeah.
b^m,"<Laughter> But, yeah,"

sv,Uh. Rollers are so messy.
sd,We never (( )) any more.
aa,"Oh, I know."

qy,"Do yo-, are you on a reg-, regular exercise program right now?"

sd,I'd say more on than off <laughter>.
b,"Okay,"
qw,what type of exercise do you do?
sd,"Uh, I do walking on the treadmill,"
sd,and then I do low impact aerobics.
bk,Okay.
qy^d,I guess you don't enjoy that very much.
ng,"Not, not really."
qy,"Do you find that, uh, to be boring?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"and time consuming,"
sv,"I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,"
sv,"it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,"
sv,"then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know."
b,Yeah.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring."
b,"Oh, yeah."

qy,"Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year <laughter>."
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not"

qy^d,I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.
ny,Uh-huh.
sd,"It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines."
sd,"But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet,"
sd,so it's collecting dust right now.
b,"<Laughter> Yeah,"
sv,a lot of things do that.
sd,"I had an,"
sd,I used to jog somewhat.
+,I had an exercise bike
sd,"I use to have one,"
sd,"and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it,"

sd,my parents have a treadmill
%,"it's, -"
sd,"when I go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then."
b,"Yeah,"

b,"Uh-huh,"
sd,"I just got the bicycle out today,"
sd,"and it was real nice outside,"
sd,had to get out to do something.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I can't ride a bike
%,so. -
sd,I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
sd,"so thought I,"
b,Oh.
+,"better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"it's too nice,"
sv,it's been too nice all weekend.
b,"But, uh, yeah,"
sv,I need to start jog something again.
sv,"I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,"
sv,"but it's terribly boring,"
sd,and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.
qy,Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?
nn,"No,"
sd,I never have.
sv,"Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries"
sd,I usually only go about a mile or two.
sd,"I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt,"
b,"Yeah,"
+,worse.
sv,"it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,or on asphalt.
sv,"Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"that's not quite so <laughter>,"
sv,"You have to have the right,"
+,so easy.
+,"type of shoes too,"
sv,"that's,"
b,Yeah.
+,very important.
b,Yeah.
sd,"I found that,"
%,"But, -"
+,true especially from walking on (( toe and fronts )) .
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often
sd,my don't get very much use <laughter>.
sv,"<Laughter> Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,I usually enjoy the exercise I do
sd,"but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program."
sd,"So I'll, I'll bicycle"
sd,"I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,"
sd,"but then I'll get tired of doing that,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.
x,(( )) .
sd,"But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,"
sd,I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.
b,"Yeah,"
ad,"well, don't let it collect dust."
ad,At least exercise while dusting it off <laughter>.
b,Yeah.
b,<Laughter> <breathing> well. -
sd,"Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program."
b,"Yeah,"
ba,"that, that'll be good."
sd,"I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise,"
sd,"an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and,"
b,Oh.
+,"uh, working out like that."
sd,And that was very helpful
sd,"we kept charts of our progress,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks."
sd,"I found that to be, uh, very helpful."
qy,Are you going to do that?
no,"Uh, I need to,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,I haven't started yet
sv,"but, uh, <laughter> it's a thought."
sv,"Well, that sounds like something good to do then."
sv,Sounds like something I should do.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,nice way to start off this spring.
x,<Laughter>.
+,Get back in shape.
qw,"How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking?"
sd,"Well, I do, -"
sd,I switch every other day
sd,one day I walk
sd,and one day I do the aerobics.
bk,"Okay,"
qw,"how far, about how far do you go walking?"
^h,"<Breathing> Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now"
sd,"I just had surgery, um, less then two months ago,"
sd,"and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half,"
bk,Okay.
sd,but I'm trying to workup to three miles.
ba,"Well, that's good."
sv,Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"It, -"
sv,"it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect."
b,Sure.
b,"Yeah,"

sv,"Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh, -"
sd,"My walkman broke,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"so I'm upset <laughter>,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud <laughter>.
b,Yeah.

sv,But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,it is
%,"and this doesn't, you know, -"
sd,my treadmill has an incline

ny,Yeah.
%,"That's the way, -"
sd,"well, I had that cat that I mentioned, (( Alfie )) ."
sd,"One morning, you know, the first thing you do is you get up and you, you, you feed this cat some-, something and, and you make sure that it can get to its litter box."
sd,"Well, --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- for some reason during the night, the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through"
sd,"and, uh, the next morning, uh, when my roommate got up and, and, uh, did not feed it right away, it decided that, that it was going to protest."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket,"
x,# <Laughter>. #
+,"# for me. Looking, looking # at me eye to eye,"
x,# <Laughter>. #
+,# all the time while it was doing it. #
^q,All right. # Have I got your attention now? #
b,"# <Laughter> # Oh, yes."
sv,Animals have a way of talking <laughter>.
sd,(( Alfie )) did.
sd,I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day.
sd,"<Laughter> I, I don't know that I'd, uh, that I'd trade my dog in for the world."
sd,"Uh, it was about two years ago she got sick on me"
sd,"and I took her to the, uh, to the vet's because she wasn't eating and, and, uh, she wasn't able to jump."
sd,"She, you know, lost all her activity"
sd,"and, uh, she stayed there for one day"
sd,"and the doctor called me up and said, uh, she had a low white cell count and that, uh, she wasn't, she was dying and, uh, suggested that I take her to a working hos-, dog hospital, animal hospital <swallowing>."
sd,So I took his suggestion
sd,"and I, uh, took the, the dog to a hospital. The dog hospital there"
sd,and they said they'd keep her there for three days.
sd,"Well, she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care <laughter>."
sd,It cost me over five hundred dollars.
ba,Ouch.
sd,"Plus, the, the, uh, the vet sent me a bill for what he did <swallowing>"
sd,"and, uh, then she recouped."
sd,She was okay for a couple of years.
sd,And then she got sick on me again
sd,and I brought her to a different vet this time
sd,and I told the vet what medication I had given her and everything <sniffing>.
sd,"And, uh, he gave me the medication, the same medication that I gave her the last time"
sd,and she was okay
sd,and she's been okay every since.
sd,It's been about two years now.
ba,"Huh. Well, that's great,"
ba,it really is.
sd,"I, <laughter> I'm glad (( that )) she was able to pull out of it (( that way )) and so cheaply the second time."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Well, the, see the problem is if, if the, if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive."
^q,What do you want to do?
sd,I probably would have had second thoughts.
aa,Yeah.
aa,"# Of course, you would. #"
sd,"# But what they, # well, what they do is, is they say, well it's going to cost, you know, twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this"
sd,"and, and, you know, and it creeps up on you."
sd,"You don't know that, uh, you know <laughter>."
sd,"You really, y-, you don't know what it's going to until it's all over."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"Uh, to give you an example. My mom had an elderly cat who, uh, whoever evidently got a hold of it -"
sd,"and, uh, the cat got sick."
sd,So she took the cat to the vet
sd,and she had the cat there for two days
sd,and then the cat died.
sd,"So the doctor had called her up and said, uh, your cat died"
^q,"and you owe me this bill,"
^q,"and oh, by the way, do you want me to, to bury the cat # <laughter>. #"
x,# <Laughter>. #
sd,"So, it cost her three hundred dollars, uh,"
sd,and she didn't get the cat back.
%,"So, yeah,"
sd,"they had to pay for all the medical, uh, bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"<Laughter> And, uh, you know, she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good <sniffing>."
sd,# So that # --
b,# Really. #
ba,Geez.
+,-- that was kind of a surprise <throat_clearing> #
%,"(( At lea-, )) #"
b,# Yeah.
qy^d,# You kind of wonder what really happened.
ny,Yeah.
%,"Well even the, you know, -"
sd,"they, they claimed they did the best that they could have have"
sd,"and then the cat, uh, died."
%,So -- -
ba,My goodness.
sd,"-- I'm, I'm looking for another cat for them. Uh,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"I, I've, I've got a little kitten, uh, that's still, uh, just being born right now."
sd,"So another five or six weeks <inhaling> I'll be bringing the little kitten over to, uh, to my folks."
sv,"Well, that, that, that, that will make their day."
aa,Yeah.
sv,"I, I think it will"
sd,"because they're both in their, in their seventies. And, uh, the cat, uh, although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes, it turns, it turns out to be, uh, uh, a pleasant experience for them."
sv,"Uh, I think they enjoy that."
bf,Only work initially.
aa,Yeah.

b,# Yeah. #

sd,I understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight.
aa,Yes.
sd,I hope you know more about it than I do.
sd,"Oh, well <laughter>, I just got through renting, reading, uh, SPACE by, uh, James Michener."
qy,"Oh, is that right?"
sv,"And so that, uh, helped out a little bit I think."
sd,I haven't read his book.
sv,I was so upset with TEXAS that I haven't gotten into any more of his books because I thought it was just horrible.
aa,"Well, he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes."
h,"Well, -"
sv,and I don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in TEXAS
sv,so I wasn't sure how credible he was.
qy,"Oh, is that right?"
qo,"But anyway, what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights?"
^h,"Well <breathing>, uh, <breathing> <noise> I'm not sure to be honest with you,"
sv,"so, uh, this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure"
%,"and, uh,"
sv,Ego trip.
+,"And, yeah,"
sv,"it was nice to go there,"
sv,but I don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I happen to live not too far away from, -"
sd,"uh, well, I've actually worked for the company that, uh, has been blamed for the Challenger disaster. Uh --"
qy,"Oh, is that right?"
+,-- Morton Thiakol.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, you know, that's been kind of a, a real negative feeling here"

b,Right.

qw,Where do you live?

b,Yeah.

b,"Uh,"

b,Oh.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"I have a sister that lives in Dallas,"
sd,that's how we got hooked up to the program was her --
b,I see.

b,I see.
%,So. -
qy^d,Carolyn Rash?
br,Pardon me?
qy,"Is her name Rash, Carolyn Rash?"
ng,"No, her name is, uh, my last name is Skidmore."
b,I see.
sd,"And her, her husband's name is, his last name is Weight."
b,I see.
%,"And, uh, -"
sv,"Well, you probably know a lot about it."
sv,"I wasn't sure that they were blaming that sp-, space disaster on one company."
x,<Breathing>.
sd,I hadn't heard that.
sd,"Well, they were."
%,"There was, uh, -"
sd,"apparently the specifications for the joints, uh, -"
sd,"they were not to perform in, uh, cold weather"
sd,"and, uh, apparently there was definitely a, a joint that did not <noise> seal,"
sd,"and, uh, if you've ever seen the size of those, uh, motors --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- that put them into space, -"
sd,"I mean, they're as long as a football field practically and --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- about twelve foot in diameter
sd,"and, and there is a lot of pressure, lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air."
b,"Oh, yeah."
%,"So it's, this book was interesting, though."
sv,"I, uh, -"
sd,"talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come, overcome to, uh, -"
sv,"it's a very complex, uh, situation to go into space."
aa,"Oh, yeah,"
aa,"I would think so, too <noise>."
%,"They would, -"
sd,"the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how, how much of a problem it is to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere."
qy,You never think about that do you?
ny,Yeah.
sv,I would think it would be harder to get up than it would be --
b,Yeah <laughter>.
+,-- getting back down.
sd,"But they have to come in at a, just the right angle."
sd,"If you come in at the wrong angle, what happens is they bounce off and go back into space --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up.
b,Right.
%,"So, -"
sd,"Well, I saw one of, some of those early space capsules at Smithsonian."
sv,I'm sure you've --
b,Oh.
+,"-- seen more of them than I have,"
sd,but --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you could see the scorch on them, you know,"
%,they had though piles --
b,Yeah.
sv,"-- but you could see where they would come off in the, how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I've, I've,"
%,"Well, I, -"
ad,"excuse me, go ahead."
+,"I would say I've never, I've never seen an actual capsule."
b,"Oh, yeah."
sd,"I've seen more, more of the motors that, that they --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- produced out there.
sd,"Well, these were the ones that John Glenn went up in --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know, and the old, old ones."
b,Yeah.
sd,"The very first ones,"
sd,the little bell type things.
sd,"People have commented how, uh, they were surprised at how small they were."
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"they really were,"
%,they --
qy^d,Looked pretty --
+,"-- just, uh, -"
+,"-- confining, huh."
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
sd,"and, uh, the whole thing was small"
sv,"and, yeah, you, I mean, you actually put it on <laughter>, you know."
qy,Is that right?
na,"You put it around you pretty much,"
sd,it was so small.
b,Huh.
sv,"Well, I thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space,"
qy,but did he go into that in the book?
ng,"Not really. Uh, <throat_clearing>,"
sv,I guess that's just to sell us on it.
sd,"One thing's, -"
sd,"I know one thing they've, they've mentioned that I didn't get from the book, by the way,"
sd,"but, it talked about, uh, -"
sd,"they're able to manufacture, uh, different kinds of crystals --"
b,"Oh, yeah."
+,"-- and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being almost, uh, nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes."
sd,It's perfectly round.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,But I'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity.
aa,"Well, that's true"
%,"and, -"
b,Yeah.
aa,That's right <laughter>.
qy,"Well, do you think we should continue to support it at the level, -"
sv,"well, I thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying."
sv,Because --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- I think those satellites, you know, or not satellites, but the spaceflights could really spy"
sv,"and with, uh --"
aa,Yes.
+,"-- with Russia's demise, I didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level."
sv,"Uh, I think they have cut it back, to be honest with you."
b,Yeah.
+,"From, from the glory days when they did the Apollo shots to the moon."
b,Uh.
sd,"Uh, I appreciate having the satellites."
sv,"You know, that's certainly made it nice for other purpose."
qy^d,I don't know if you have a satellite dish or not.
sd,We don't --
nn,"No,"
sd,I don't.
sd,I don't --
sv,-- but I --
+,-- either.
+,-- I know that's certainly helped a lot --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- in that regard. Uh,"
sv,"Gun control seems to be a rather, uh, timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise."
aa,Yes <laughter>.
sd,"And, uh, the, the interesting scale that they assigned it, uh, the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free <breathing>."
sv,"I'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle, I guess."
sv,"I, I don't mind regulating all of the, the guns"
sv,and I would certainly call for a ban on certain types.
sv,"Now the, the wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a debate forever, I would assume."
sv,"Uh, the method of, of controlling it, well that's all into how much money you want to put into the, the controls."
sd,"Uh, one point that was made in the <breathing> House hearings -"
%,or -
sd,"the representative stood up and said, you know, we can check a guy's credit card instantly,"
^q,"but, uh, we don't want to check his background,"
sv,and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes --
b,Right.
%,"-- uh, -"
sd,"but there still, the, the technology exists to, to check it if they want."
%,"So, it's, it's kind of a, <breathing> -"
sv,I guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that.
sd,"And then you've got the group of people that decide that there's, there's no particular reason to have them at all"
sv,and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it
sv,"and I guess I would fall more in the, the realm that I like the sport issue of it,"
sd,"but I, I could give it up without too much trouble,"
sv,not the world's most pleasurable thing
sv,"and it costs a bit to do it,"
b,Yes <laughter>.
+,"uh, finding ranges and things like that."
b,Right.
sd,"Uh, I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years,"
sv,but it's just not like golf or whatever.
sv,I mean there are other things that you could go do.
sv,"So, uh, I, I don't see the, the joy of shooting as, as that much of a driving factor."
sv,"I think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"I don't even keep the gun in our house,"
b,Right.
sd,"so I don't have that problem,"
%,"but, uh, <breathing> -"
sv,"it's a hard, hard topic, I guess."
sv,"A lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings about it."
aa,"They do,"
sd,"and you, boy you can get them on either side"
sd,"and just like you say,"
sv,"uh, well I think I, I guess I'd have to place myself, uh, probably seven or eight <laughter>,"
%,"because, -"
ar,"or not, -"
sd,"w-, w-, onto no control, -"
fa,"I'm sorry, excuse me, that, -"
sd,"uh, two or three. -"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,I was going the wrong direction.
sd,"Uh, because of, we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child --"
+,-- because they had a gun in the house
sd,"and the father kept the bullets in a separate place,"
sd,"but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to,"
sd,"uh, he knew where booth, both places were, loaded the gun"
sd,and they were playing cowboys and Indians
sd,and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes.
%,"So, uh, -"
sd,"I mean it,"
sd,it destroyed two families --
b,Right.
+,"-- uh, in just that instant"
sv,"and, and I, a lot of people say that they need it for protection, uh,"
sd,"having worked at one time in Baltimore, -"
%,"or, -"
sd,"I don't know if you're in the big city,"
sd,Dallas.
qy,"are you, -"
br,Dallas?
ny,Uh-huh.
sv,That's a big city <laughter>.
b,Yeah.
%,"Uh, then you know that, uh, uh, -"
sv,"if you live anywhere real close that, uh, -"
%,"the safety is, uh, -"
sv,"some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know."
sd,"But, uh, uh, we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up."
%,"Uh, I, uh, -"
sd,"once, uh, uh, knew a fellow that had, had been a policeman"
sd,"and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume that you know how to use it well,"
sd,"and he's going to, you know, try to shoot first."
b,Right.
sd,"Uh, <laughter> so, you know, if he's got one."
sd,"Uh, and if not,"
sd,"uh, then usually they, uh,"
sd,"if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you,"
%,"I mean, you know --"
b,Right.
+,"-- they, they, -"
sd,"he said that it, it was better not to have, -"
sd,"especially myself, now I'm a widow,"
%,"and, uh, -"
sd,"I, so I'm, when my handicapped son is, is not at home, I'm by myself,"
%,"but, uh, there's, -"
sd,"I still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really <breathing>, uh, playing Russian Roulette if you do <laughter>."
%,"Uh, -"
b,Yeah.
sv,"About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the, the, person was coming your way."
sv,"Once you're surprised, it's too late."
aa,That's right.
%,"And, and the rare,"
aa,That's right.
+,"circum-, -"
sv,"you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming,"
b,Right.
sv,and had time to do anything about it.
aa,That's right.
sd,"And, I don't have that problem,"
sd,as I don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one.
sd,"In the, uh, N R As, uh, claim that the, uh, the constitutional, the right to bear arms and that whole statement, uh,"
sv,"it's hard to know the original intent,"
sv,"but I, I don't see it as that, that difficult of a <breathing> story to believe when the opposition says that, uh, yeah, it's the right to, to arm a militia and, as opposed to just the general public."
b,Right.
sv,"And you have a, you have a earn a right,"
sv,"not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia,"
sv,"then you have a right to have that arm,"
%,"but, uh, -"
aa,That's right.
sd,"you know, there's all sorts of arguments there --"
aa,I know <laughter>.
sd,"-- but, I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,"
b,No.
sd,they didn't have this problem back then <laughter>.
aa,"No,"
aa,that's true.
aa,"That,"
sv,"So, we change our rights with our social status."
+,"That's, that's right,"
aa,that's right.
sd,They're man given rights
sd,"and they can be taken away by a man,"
%,"so, -"
b,Right.
sd,"<Breathing> uh, the people that hide behind that, I don't worry about."
sd,They can go live in another country if they want.
b,"Well, yeah,"
sd,"that's how I feel, too."
sd,"I know, well, -"
sd,"e-, even here where I work, uh, we have a, a gun club."
sd,"And, of course, those people are very avid."
sd,"They, you know,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"they say there should be no ban,"
%,"that it's not, -"
sv,"but I can't see why any, uh, o-, on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun."
b,Right.
sv,"Uh, you know, when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide,"
sv,"but there are a few guns that, uh, just are not, uh, sport,"
%,"or, I mean,"
sd,I don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either <laughter>.
b,Right.
sv,"So, uh, I, I think they should have at least some control over, over those things."
sd,"Uh, and when you were speaking about how they can check up, you know, on credit cards,"
sd,"well, I, I understand about the privacy act and everything,"
qw,but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not.
sv,"That, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing."
b,Right.
sd,"And if they do,"
sd,"course the argument with the people in the gun club, uh, is that, uh, well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway."
b,Right.
sd,"And so, it's not going to be that they're buying them."
sv,"Course, some of them do."
b,Yeah.
sv,"So it, it is a hard question <laughter>."
bf,"Tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people."
sv,"Most regulation does <laughter>,"
aa,"Right,"
aa,"oh, yeah."
%,"and, most, -"
sv,"it's very difficult to, uh, legislate, uh, crooks or whatever you want, however you want to word it --"
aa,That's right.
%,"-- so it's, -"
sv,"well, this may be a never ending topic."
sd,"I got a couple of calls waiting on me,"
fc,so I'd better let you go.
fc,"Okay,"
fc,well thanks for talking.
fc,"Okay, bye."
fc,<Laughter> Bye-bye now.
qw,"Uh, so what do you do to exercise?"
%,"Uh, s-, -"
sd,"I, uh, weight train, uh, three days on and one day off."
bk,Uh-huh.
sd,"I, uh, ride bicycles, <breathing>, uh, fifteen, twenty miles, I don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week."

sd,"Uh, that's what I do."
%,Um.
qo,What about yourself?
sv,That's pretty impressive.
sd,"Uh, I guess I bicycle."
sd,"Uh, the amount varies"
sd,as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week.
bk,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, I guess a play softball one night a week."
sd,And I backpack a lot over the summer.
bh,"Oh, really?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"that's, that's about the extent of it."
sd,"I mean, I don't do any of those things particularly, you know, for exercise."
sd,"But, uh, I guess the bicycling is the one thing I'll sort of, like, do if I feel like I need to go exercise <breathing>."
sd,"Uh, but I do it mostly for fun."
b,"Yeah,"
qy,"uh, what do you ride, uh, like, a bunch of hills or pretty flat?"
sd,"It, it, it varies."
sd,"Uh, out near my house is pretty hilly."
sd,"Uh, but sometimes I bike to work which is about, uh, a fifteen mile trip each way."
sd,And that's mostly flat.
qw,How long does that take you to get to work?
sd,"Uh, about forty-five, fifty minutes."
qw,"How d-, how does that work, work out with, uh, storing your bike and showering and all that?"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,it can be a pain.
sd,"Uh, basically, uh, I work on a campus"
sd,"so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the, uh, campus to the, uh, gym, use the shower there --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- uh, but, it's, it's enough of a pain, that I did it consistently one year,"
sd,"I would commute every day, uh,"
sd,but it just became such a pain.
sd,"I mean we're talking, you know, forty-five, fifty minutes for biking,"
b,Right.
+,"uh, and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind. And then another half an hour, you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff."
sd,"It was a big hunk, hunk of the day <breathing>."
sd,"Uh, and then of course another hour to get back home."
sd,"Uh, so I've been doing that less, and, and concentrating more on, you know, light biking when I get home on the evening and then, you know, some more on the weekends."
b,Yeah.
qy,Do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there?
ng,Not so much.
sd,"Uh, I guess mostly I bike on my own."
sd,I've got a touring bike.
b,Uh-huh.
+,"Uh, though I haven't gone on any extended trips with it."
qo,"How about you,"
qw,what kind of biking do you do?
^h,"Uh, well, actually my wife just got me into it"
sd,"and I did an, did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"the Cooper Clinic,"
sd,"and I learned all the health benefits of, you know, -"
sd,"I was a solid weight trainer,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,and all I did was weights and aerobic exercise
sd,"and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it,"
sd,"so,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"once I got into this, uh, internship, I learned all the physiological ad-, advan-, advantages to it,"
sd,"so I began a program couple, I don't know probably three or four weeks ago"
sd,and I did my first bike rally this Saturday.
sd,"I did, uh, forty, forty miles,"
%,Um.
sd,"and, uh, that's the longest I've ever ridden so far,"
sd,"I usually, you know, fifteen or twenty."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And it was, it was kind of hilly"
sd,"and it was pretty tough,"
sd,"but, uh, I'm looking at, uh, doing a lot more of it because, you know, my wife is really into it,"
b,"Oh, I see."
sd,"and I, I kind of held her back a little bit this, this weekend."
sd,"She wanted to go, go, go,"
sd,"but,"
b,Uh-huh.

sv,It's good to have a partner.
aa,Yeah
aa,it really is.
qy,"Are you think of doing any, like, centuries, or ... -"
ny,"Yeah,"
sv,"that would be cool sometime if I could, you know, work up to that."
b,Uh-huh.
b,"Yeah,"
qy,"I just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like, you know, uh, <breathing> uh, touring like from Vermont or, you know, that kind of,"
b,Oh.
+,thing.
sv,I mean people seem to get into different aspects.
sv,"One is more of a distance, -"
sv,"and one's more, just, you know, -"
sv,they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.
sd,I've never really looked into that.
%,"That, you know, that's, -"
sd,my wife would just love that.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And I may do that sometime.
sd,"There again, I'm just kind of a fledgling into this."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"I've, it's kind of funny."
sd,I called this number
sd,and I was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up.
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
sd,"I mean, around Texas, you, you got about five or six,"
sd,"if you live around the Dallas area, you got five or six every weekend to choose from."
ba,"Oh, that's nice."
+,Because they're really into it.
%,Um.
sd,Bicycling is really big here.
sd,"I didn't know that, and, you know, until I came down here, and,"
ba,Wow.
+,kind of caught the fever.
b,Yeah.
sd,Because I lived in Indiana all my life
sd,"and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, or above the age of fifteen or something, --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- but, other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I'm not sure why that is.
sv,"I mean, generally in the Midwest it seems to be less, much less."
sv,"I mean, maybe it's because of the winters."
aa,Probably.
+,"Uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the West."
b,Yeah.
sv,So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation.
b,Yeah.
sd,"It, there's a lot of bikers around here."
sv,"It's, it's really neat."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"There are a lot of, a lot of resources, a lot of magazines, and stuff,"
sd,"little TEXAS BICYCLIST, is like a little newspaper that comes out every month."
%,Um.
sd,It's free
ad,"just go to the bike shock, bi-, bike shop and pick it up,"
sd,"and it's got all the rides coming up,"
sd,"so I guess I'm going to be busy about every Saturday this summer,"
ba,"Oh, that's terrific."

%,"Yeah,"
sd,see a little bit of Texas I've never seen before.
b,Uh-huh.
qw,"So, uh, how long have you been biking?"
sd,"Oh, I guess as an adult for just about the past, uh, three years or so <breathing>."
sd,"Uh, you know, I guess last time I did it before that was college, which was about ten years ago."
bk,Yeah.
b,"And, uh, yeah,"
sd,"I guess I just never really thought about it much for a while, uh, until I suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot."
sd,"And so I thought I'd try it, too."
qy,"Have you ever had a, uh, it's kind of slightly off the subject, but you ever had a, uh, a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking,"
nn,"No,"
sd,"I haven't,"
nn,no.
+,"to see if it, -"
sv,"because it really, from what I understand, it really improves your, uh, cholesterol --"
%,Um.
sd,"-- and, you know, it, uh, <breathing> it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is, uh, uh, low cardiovascular fitness, and also, uh, you know, the cholesterol."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,It gives you increased H D Ls and decreases your L D Ls.
ba,"Oh, that's great."
b,"Yeah,"
%,so ... -
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I've, I've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate, my resting pulse."
b,Yeah.
sd,"You know, it gets it down to about forty."
bh,Really?
ny,Yeah.
ba,That's good.
b,Yeah.
qy^d,"You say you ride about a hundred, hundred fifty miles a week?"
ny,Yeah.
ba,Man.
sv,"That's, that's hard-core."
sd,"On average,"
%,yeah.
qw,When do you get to begin with the winters and all that?
qw,"What time of the year do you usually embark on your, -"
qy,do you ride inside if you can't ride outside?
nn,"No,"
sd,I'm not that hard-core.
sv,"I mean there are some people, -"
sd,in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow.
sd,"They've got a, uh, mountain bike,"
x,<laughter>.
+,"you know, with the big knobby tires."
b,Yeah.
sd,"And, I don't do that."
sd,"I basically, I, I pretty much lay off for the winter."
sd,"Uh, I was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter, you know, because it will help your balance when you're indoor training."
%,Um.
sd,"Uh, but I just, you know, more or less stocked, like an exercise bike and that kind of thing. <breathing>, uh,"
%,"but, yeah,"
sv,I mean winters are kind of a problem
sd,"so, I'm more or less out of shape now that I've been biking, I guess, this year for just a couple of weeks."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, but, you know, up here <laughter>, it's only stopped snowing since then."
b,Yeah.
%,"Uh, <lipsmack>, but, yeah,"
sv,"it's, it's, it's, it's pretty good."
%,"It's, uh, -"
sd,"the main, the main thing, I guess, for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like, you know, exercise and a chore <laughter>, I'll lay off it more."
b,Right.
bf,"So you, uh, change up your routes a lot, and keep a ... -"
aa,"Oh, yeah,"
aa,yeah.
sd,"I try to go someplace pretty different, you know, every week."
sd,"I rotate around, uh, about four different routes, uh, from my house"
sd,or I'll sometimes come in the school.
sd,"It's nice coming,"
sd,"it's, it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path <breathing>, uh,"
sd,"because it's just, it's along the Erie Canal up here."
qw,"So, what school is it?"
sd,"Uh, University of Rochester."
bk,"Oh, okay."
b,Yeah.
sv,So it's fairly picturesque.
b,Yeah.
sd,"And, uh, so it's, it's, it's a good ride"
sv,"as long as you're not doing it every day, it's a good ride <laughter>."
aa,Yeah.
aa,That's true.
ba,Sounds neat.
b,Yeah.
%,"It's kind of, -"
sd,"I was wondering if I was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else,"
sd,but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week.
sv,"That's, uh, motivating."
b,Yeah.
sv,That's really good.
fc,Well --

fc,All right.
fc,Take care.
fc,Bye.
fc,Bye.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Okay,"
sd,"we're going to talk about the public school system,"
b,Okay.
+,"What's wrong with it, an, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it, what should be done about it."
ba,Fantastic.
sd,"Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, uh, about the, uh, funding of, the, the school system right now."
b,Yeah.
sv,"Evidently, uh, that's, that's a big problem."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"it's amazing, uh,"
sv,"I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, I mean,"
b,Right.

sd,"When I was in college I, I enjoyed teaching,"
sd,'cause I did some teaching part-time
sd,and I really enjoyed that
sd,"but I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high,"
sd,"it just, you know, all the problems."
b,"Oh, Lord, I mean, yeah,"
sd,"an, you talk about stress and pressure,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","I tell you what,"
%,"it's, uh, -"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week,"
sv,"I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready."
%,"Do, -"
b,right.
sv,"And, you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid."
aa,"Exactly,"
%,"and, -"
sd,"And we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for, for what, you know."
aa,"<Laughter> That's right,"
sv,"and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like Tarpley."
b,Yeah.
%,"But, uh, I (( )) -"
sv,"what gets me is I can't believe that Congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school."
%,"You know, it's, uh, -"
sd,I just don't understand that.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"it's, uh. -"
qy,"Now do you have little kids, or what?"
nn,"No, uh,"
sd,"sure don't,"
sd,my wife and I've just been married about two years
sd,"but I have a sister that's a, uh, school teacher,"
%,"and, uh. -"
b,"Yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"my wife and I have a, a three year old, almost four and a, a two year old."
b,Okay.
sd,"So we're looking at the, the older one going to school next year. Not, not, well not this coming fall but the year after that."
b,"Okay,"
bf,so it's getting close.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"he's going to be going to kindergarten,"
%,so. -
b,Right.
sd,"So, you know, we're, we're thinking about that."
qh,What's that going to be like.
qh,"Are they going to be taught nothing,"
qh,"or they going be taught something,"
sd,"we're going to, we're going to be involved in our child's education."
sd,"We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course,"
b,Right.
+,"because, uh, I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad, uh,"
sv,but.
aa,Exactly.
+,"But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere."
aa,"Right,"
aa,that's true.
+,"You know,"
sv,"and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, we-, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or do, or un-, understand some science."
aa,Exactly.
+,"You know, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","I mean give me a break,"
sv,"that's, that's, that's bogus."
aa,"Right,"
aa,right.
sd,"Well and, uh, you know, one thing my wife and I've talked about, i-, are, uh, private schools."
b,Yeah.
+,"You know whether, uh, uh, we would want to invest in, in private schools as they're g-, growing up, because, you know, just in the Dallas area, um, we're not real comfortable with the, with the public schools."
sd,"And Dallas, uh, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling."
b,Right.
sd,I couldn't believe that.
b,Right.
sd,"You know, <breathing> one, that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano."
sd,"We were hoping, you know, well the school district's going to be good, you know, for resale value, and,"
b,Yeah.
+,"so on and so forth,"
sd,"but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding."
sv,I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way
sv,but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.
sv,"That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, and people are going to throw a fit."
%,"That's, -"
b,"yeah,"
%,"and, you know, that's, -"
sv,taxes right now are political suicide.
b,"Oh, yeah."
+,"You know,"
sv,"and I don't think any politician's going to do that,"
%,so. -
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"and the only thing, they, they would think of would be tuition, you know,"
sv,if it works at colleges it will work down below.
b,Right.
sv,"And, you know, that's going to, that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do."
sv,"But, it will be hard for those that people, that have, have in school because they have to pay out even more."
aa,Exactly.
sv,"And, you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, I think."
b,"Oh, yeah."
+,"Because, uh, they're the ones that will probably have to, to carry the brunt of the load."
aa,That's right.
%,"So, uh, -"
sv,"And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and, and knives and everything, -"
ba,"I mean, good grief what's (( )) . -"
b,Yeah
sd,"now, that's, that's just unbelievable to me, you know."
sd,I can't believe that.
sd,I mean when I was in junior high and high school that never happened.
sd,You never heard about that.
b,"Well yeah,"
sd,"we didn't, we didn't even think about it, you know <laughter>."
b,No.
qh,"And now, you know, what do we have now."
sd,"You know, got kids that, (( )) either got a, you know, a Magnum gun school, -"
ba,like good grief.
b,"R-, right."
sv,"I mean, I'd, I'd be afraid to be in school, I mean b-, teaching, or even being a student"
ad,"and think what, what's it going to be like for my, my youngest, an my oldest son, when he goes to school."
qh,What's going to happen?
sd,"I mean I, I'm afraid for him to go."
aa,"Exactly,"
aa,right.
sv,"But there (( again )) , you can't hold them back."
%,"Another reason, yo-, -"
sv,"and you want to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school,"
sv,"but, uh, you know, with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative things, it is, uh, it's a tough environment to be growing up in."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school,"
%,"and that was, -"
sd,"well I was, I graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine,"
%,so. -
b,Okay.
qy^d,"That was what, twelve years ago, I guess."
na,Right.
sv,"So, you know, it's lot different now."
qh,"And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, uh, oldest son is in high school."
aa,"That's right,"
aa,that's right.
sd,"I'm afraid to, I'm afraid to even think about it."
aa,"That, yeah, that is a scary thought,"
h,"but, uh, I don't know,"
sv,"I, I guess what you have to do is just, uh, keep in, uh, you know, encouraging them and, and, uh, uh, try to be open with them, so that y-, you can deal with the problems as they come up."
sv,<Barking>. That's all you can do.
b,"Yeah,"
%,and. -
sv,"You got to, you got to be your child's best friend, I guess,"
b,Right.
+,"even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish,"
sv,"still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or, or your parents."
aa,Exactly.
+,"You know,"
sv,"an, and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape."
aa,That's right.
sv,"And, and the schools don't, don't really encourage to stay away from that, you know,"
sv,"the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera."
sv,They don't teach them good values like drugs are bad.
h,"I, maybe I'm wrong, because I haven't, you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time,"
sv,"but,"
b,Right.
+,"it just is amazing, you know,"
sv,need to teach them good values.
aa,"That's true,"
aa,"that's true,"
%,"and, uh. -"
sv,"Of course, wh-, if I say this is a good value, someone else is going to stand up and say, oh no."
sv,And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit.
b,Right.
+,"Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, you know."
sv,"Well and I think, uh, you touched on it, you know,"
sv,you've got to start them at the home.
b,Yeah.
+,You know
sv,"that's where they, that's where they get the, the deep rooted values"
sv,"and,"
sv,That's all you can do.
+,"and, and, uh, and that's about right."
sv,"Then you just have to hope and pray that, that everything, uh, works out, works out okay,"

aa,That's right.

fc,"Okay,"

b,Uh-huh.

sd,"but, uh, I have been to Peru,"

sd,I have a brother who spent two years in Bolivia.

b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sv,"And there's, there's a sad joke."

qw,How bad is it?
qy,Do you have smog like they do in California?
%,"Well it, it -"
no,"some, -"
sv,"I think it depends on, uh, you know, what the, ho-, the cloud cover -"
sd,"and like right now, it's, uh, it's kind of overcast, you know,"
sd,"just, it's hot,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"and the sun is trying, tries to shine through"
sv,"but it's, it's holding in this, this pollution"
%,"and I, -"
sv,"It depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion, I take it."
aa,"I think so,"

b,Yeah.
sd,"and we have, uh, Pasadena, Texas which is sort of between here an, you know, heading toward Galveston,"
sd,"I mean it's still part of, it's part of the Houston metroplex."
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
qw,What do you think is your primary cause of it.
sv,"Well, I think it's industry"
sv,and I think it's cars.
qy^d,You do?
qy,You really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas?
%,"I don't, I, -"
h,"well maybe not,"
sv,"but, it, it sure, it sure, se-, -"
%,"you know, it, -"
sd,"I, I know that when I'm, when I'm behind a car -"
sd,"and, uh, sometimes, uh, I can really smell especially diesel and things like that,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"you know, comes right into my air conditioner"
sd,"and, you know, my head and my fa-, -"
sd,"I'm so stopped up right now,"
b,"Um,"
ba,my goodness.
sd,"I don't know if it's, uh, if it's partly from what's blooming, you know, right now, pollen and stuff like that,"
sd,"that's part of it,"
%,"but, um. -"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,I think a lot of it's industrial.
sv,"I also think, uh, that, uh, there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles"
sv,but it's mostly from older automobiles.
sv,"I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"I think that, uh, I think that, uh, uh, -"
%,"if, uh, -"
sd,"I, I, I heard a story a while back"
sd,"something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining.
qy,"You mean, uh, fifty percent pollution total --"
ny,Yeah.
+,"-- from that comes from, -"
^2,"From, from cars -"
sd,"that is, not, not total but just from cars, -"
%,okay.
bk,"Oh, uh-huh."
sv,"So, that I think would be tremendous help."
sd,But I happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical
sd,"and it just keeps getting, uh, gives me good service"
sd,and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,But I don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies.
b,Right.
sv,"And, uh, that may be part of the problem."
%,"Als-, -"
qy,"Do you all have pollution in your co-, part of the country, uh, from industry?"
ny,"Yeah, ause"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"oh, uh, yeah,"
sv,"it's, it's, uh, pretty heavy up here I think"
sv,"but I think it's mostly industrial, is what I really, uh, believe is the, the main problem."
%,"And, and, uh, ause -"
sv,"and, uh, uh, people, uh, I don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should."
sv,"I, I we, we seem to have a high, uh, cancer rate up here in Maryland."
bh,"Really,"
ny,"Yeah,"
%,"and, uh, -"
%,"like what ki-, -"
qy,any particular kind or just all kinds?
sv,"Well, for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant"
%,"and, uh, I think, -"
sv,"of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody,"
sd,"but, uh, th-, this state was like the second, -"
sd,"my wife's a registered nurse,"
sv,"and I think this state was like second this year from the top, in terms of, uh, cancer rate for just all kinds."
sv,And I can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution.
sv,"I just don't know exactly what it necessarily is,"
sv,but I just can't believe it is.
b,Um.
sd,"Now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph-, uh, fluorocarbons which is the, like freon twelve and freon twenty-two."
sd,"They use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners
sv,and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And I can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer, that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also,"
sv,"and having all kinds of effects,"
%,and. -
qw,"Well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem?"
sd,"Well they're working now, -"
sd,"I know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working, uh, feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons,"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"and who ever does is going to make, uh, a mint."
sd,"Because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons, then, uh, -"
qy,"Is that also what's in, uh, hairsp-, aerosol?"
na,"Well they used to be,"
sd,but they made them take it out of that.
qy^d,"Even, so, so the aerosol is still aerosol,"
na,Right.
qy^d,but it doesn't have anything that's damaging.
nn,"No,"
sd,"they, they, they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers,"
b,"Uh-huh,"
sv,well that's good.
sv,and that was a move in the right direction.
sd,We are doing some things to try to correct the problem.
sv,But there are more things we could do
sv,"and getting rid of old cars, like I said is one way to help correct the problem."
sv,"Uh, uh, just trying to I think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage,"
sd,"I notice in this state, -"
sd,"I don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not,"
sd,"but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces, uh, you know, containers in,"
%,yeah.
sd,"Here, they've just started, started doing that,"
%,"it's, it's, you know, -"
sd,"you're not, you don't have to, -"
%,"but m-, you know, -"
sd,I know I am.
sd,"I save, -"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too.
%,"But they, uh, -"
sd,"in one of the counties here, they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police."
sd,They have a lady that goes around like a meter maid
sd,and she spot checks people's trash.
ba,"No kidding,"
b,"really,"
b,oh.
sd,"And if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash,"
bh,Is that right.
+,they'll fine you fifty bucks I think the first time and two fifty the second time.
sv,"Well, we need to do something,"
sv,we need to get serious about it.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"you, -"
b,"right,"
sv,"you've got to get people to see i-, -"
sv,"and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it."
sd,They've stopped that up here too.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But that, that will cut pollution too."
sv,"Because you get a lot of out gassing from these things, I think, decaying and tr-, and trying to, -"
sd,"for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But on, on the other hand, I don't guess they're polluting."
sv,"But plastic containers and the like, uh, they may be,"
sd,I'm not sure of that.
qo,"How much does, uh, planting more trees and things like that help?"
sv,Oh I think that's very important to do.
%,(( )) too.
sv,"I, I really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And, uh, that can help to cut pollution, I guess some."
sv,"I, I don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air."
sv,"I would hope that they would help some, though."
sv,That's for sure.
sv,"I think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know, -"
x,<Throat_clearing>.
sd,"we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway."
sd,I think they got caught.
ba,Oh good.
sd,"But I wonder how much of that kind of stuff, you know, goes on."
sv,"Well that, uh, that I think may go on a lot"
sv,"and the primary reason I think it may go on a lot is just as you said, somebody happened to stay up late at night or something."
sv,"I don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry."
sv,"Uh, we have good policing, at least in this state and, and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too, of car pollutants"
sd,"because we have to go down, uh, once a year here in Maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content."
sd,"Uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year."
b,Uh-huh.
qy,Do you all have that?
nn,"Uh, no,"
sd,"we don't have a state inspection,"
%,"So, -"
%,"which I, -"
%,"I don-, -"
%,"I would assu-, -"
sd,but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state.
qy^d,"So I'm assu-, I'm assuming that, you know, they check, they check everything for safety"
%,"or, -"
no,"I don't know,"
sd,"uh, that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities."
sd,"But in this state we have to, uh, pay eight dollars and a half and go to a, an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are, have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three."
qy^d,"But that's all they check for,"
qy^d,"they don't check how good, -"
qy^d,if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough.
nn,"No,"
nn,"no,"
sd,we don't have inspections like that.
sd,"Now, I'm in Maryland,"
sv,"in Virginia they check that every two years, I think."
sd,"We do that ev-, every year."
sv,"And I think that's a good idea too,"
sd,"not, no-, not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily,"
sv,but I think it's a good idea.
sd,"The emission check, though, is required in Maryland"
sd,"and it's also required in Virginia, uh, a sister state to, to this one."
sv,"And that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants."
sd,"Well I'll have to check,"
sd,"I'm not sure if, if our state inspection ever-, -"
sd,"once a year has to do, you know, -"
sd,"if they check the, uh, -"
b,"Uh-huh,"
sv,"well if they don't I would imagine in time they'll get a law with. i-, get around to it,"
sv,"and if they don't then that's something I would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh, -"
sd,"Oh, I would <laughter>."
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
sd,"I'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or, or, or anything."
aa,"Oh yeah,"
aa,"I, I agree."
sd,Now that's another area we haven't even discussed
sd,"and that is water pollution and various of the other types of, uh, of, uh, like food pollution."
sd,"I mean you, you hardly ever hear, hear anybody say anything about food pollution."
sv,"But I think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries,"
sd,"so, uh, hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of, uh, pollutants in our food."
%,"But water pollution, uh, -"
sd,"I've worried, especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,I know a lot more people are going to bottled water.
arp_nd,Well -
sv,and that's not necessarily the answer either
sd,because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap.
b,"Yeah,"
b^m,"tap,"
%,yeah <laughter>.
%,"So, -"
%,"but a lot of these, uh, -"
%,some of this -
sv,"well, you know, a lot of people have well water,"
sd,in fact in this area too
%,"and, an, you know, -"
%,"and, uh, -"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're, what you're drinking"
sd,"and I, I know a lot of people, you know, have that"
sv,"and, you know, you have to wonder if that, you know could have an adverse affect on them too,"
b,Yeah.
+,"if they don't, i-, they don't get it checked."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course, have it checked"
sv,"because it seems, uh, -"
sd,"when I was a kid growing up down south, uh, I used to go out in the country where my grandparents were"
sd,"and we had a well,"
sd,"it was one of those draws that, -"
sd,"I forget what you call those things,"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"and, and that was some of the best tasting water,"
sd,"I mean, I can still to this day taste that water."
%,"When we were, -"
sd,"when I was growing up I lived in Huntsville, Alabama,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"and their water supply came from, uh, spring."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And it was like ice cold, spring water"
sd,"and I guess parts of the, the city still ha-, you know, get that,"
sv,"but, uh, that was, that was really wonderful."
ba,"Oh, I bet it was."
sv,"It was really, really good."
b,"Yeah,"
%,"the-, -"
sv,"once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well, filtered through all the earth and everything I think that, uh, -"
sv,it depends of course where you are.
sv,"A good well, though, I think is very healthy ..."
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Okay, uh,"
qw,"could you tell me what you think contributes most to, uh, air pollution?"
^h,"Well, it's hard to say."
sv,"I mean, while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, uh, it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all."
qo,What do you think?
sd,"Um, well, you talked about, uh, volcanos."
sd,"I'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now, and, and what the amount of material that they do, uh, put into the atmosphere."
sv,"I think probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,especially around cities.
qy,"Um, uh, do you live right in the city itself?"
nn,"No,"
sd,"I'm more out in the suburbs,"
sd,but I certainly work near a city.
bk,"Okay,"
qy,"so ca-,"
qo,How about you?
+,"Can you notice, -"
%,"well it's, it's, -"
sd,I live in a rural area.

sd,There's the freeways
sd,"and we get an occasional, -"
sd,"it depends which way the wind's blowing from Boston, cause we're like forty miles south of Boston,"
sd,so we'll pick up that.
sd,"And, uh, I've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh, -"
sd,we live about twenty miles away from the state airport
sd,"and I notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger,"
sd,"they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over, over our homes."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And, it seems like, uh, we're catching all that residue."
sd,I'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping.
sd,"But, other than that, you know, we don't have the, unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions."
b,Yeah.
+,You know from the power plants. Um.
bf,You mean like from the coal.

ny,"yeah,"
sd,"we generate, -"

sd,but I'm not sure about the rest of the country.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,I notice locally a major problem is Kodak.
sv,"Um, it's interesting"
sd,"because in order to, uh, keep with the E P A standards which, which tend to be visible, uh, what's coming out of your smokestack, they do all their emissions at night."
sd,"Uh, so people get up, -"
b,"Okay,"
bh,"well, is that right? <laughter>."
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,people get up in the morning in that neighborhood

b,"Yeah,"
ba,"surprise, surprise."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"I mean, I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky, photograph the emissions at that point, and, uh, you know, -"
b,Yeah.
sv,"There, there must be, uh, uh, some of the, some of the, uh, larger plants up, uh, up around one hundred twenty-eight."
b,Uh-huh.

b,Right.

b,Right.

sd,I can't remember where -
sd,"I, I read that recently somewhere,"
sd,and I can't remember where.
b,"Yeah,"
ba,"that's interesti-,"
sv,"But I, I thought it was up there."
sv,"So, that's interesting because New Hampshire,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"and parts of Vermont, um, they showed pictures of, of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain."
%,Um.
qy,"Um, you kind of think it's something else then?"
arp_nd,"Well, that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article."

bf,"Oh, they didn't say, they didn't say what though,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","they just said they thought it was, -"
na,"They didn't say what,"
sd,"they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected. Um, that it may be other natural things at work. Um,"
bf,"Uh, natural disease,"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"so it's, it's less than clear."
sd,"Like I said, I don't remember the article that well."
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
h,"But, um, I don't know,"
qw,"I mean, what do you think we can, uh, I guess as individuals or as a group, do about, uh, air pollution? <<pause>>."
sv,"Uh, we can demand, uh, more efficient automobiles for one thing."
sv,"I still think that's, that's, uh, one of our major causes of pollutants."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, how we go about that, it's uh, uh, it's a little bit difficult."
sv,"I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for,"
b,"Yeah,"
+,for less pollutant vehicles.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"you ne-, yo-, ne-, I think you need a, a vehicle something like, uh, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, or,"
b,Yeah.
+,"where, uh, or, uh, uh, A A R P, which has a lot of members."
b,Uh-huh.
+,"Uh, if you can get those types of groups."
qy,Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.
sd,"I mean, I remember reading an article that said like, it's, uh, the older polluters,"
sd,"the, the twelve and fifteen year old cars, you know, contribute like ninety percent,"
b,"Yeah,"
+,of the automobile pollution
sv,"and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly anything."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"they're better,"
qh,but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there.
qw,"Uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, uh, -"
b,"Yeah,"
qy,but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune.
no,"Uh, I'm not really sure."
qy^d,"You think that, that, that the, uh, the trucking indus-, industry is that, uh, incompetent, that they wouldn't, you know, -"
sd,"fuel is, is one of their biggest costs."
b,Right.
%,"So, you would, -"
%,But diesel engines.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,diesel engines.
%,"It, you know, it's, it, -"
sv,"I mean, they do generate a lot of soot"
sv,"but that at least, that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly."
b,Yeah.
b,Yeah.
sd,"We could also, uh, push for legislation for, uh, rapid transit systems."
sv,This country seems to be a little behind on that.
b,Yeah.
sv,On the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient.
b,"Um, yeah,"
sv,"but only because we got used to, uh, single person, single car,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,driving.
sv,A lot of people don't even like to carpool.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,But we could that.
sv,"That'll help,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"pollution, air pollution,"
sd,"The, uh, United States and Canada are I guess, is, is, going into, uh, some types of agreements to limit, uh, what's being given out by power plants,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,"
b,"Yeah,"
b,sure.
sv,So that's helping.
qw,"Well, what do you think about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted?
ba,Now that's an idea.
ad,"don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your <laughter> tail pipe generating # generating revenue, #"
sd,"# Well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little # you don't have to pay any tax"
sd,or you just buy one of these things
%,"and it, it, uh, -"
sv,"maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe"
sd,"and, uh, the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts"
sd,and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
sd,and you couldn't start your car anymore.
ba,"That's a, that's an interesting concept."
qy,Is that your idea?
ny,"Yeah,"
%,"but, uh, you know, it's, uh, -"
sv,"I guess the difficulty would be to, that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again"
sv,so you probably would have to build it right into # the muffler or something. #
sd,"# Well I was going to say, #"
aa,right.
sd,"You could put it in, you could, you could, it could be installed like a catalytic converter."
b,Right.
sv,I mean I guess you could take those off too
%,"but, -"
%,"You could take ca-, -"
sv,but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"if you can take a muffler off and only replace, -"
sd,well not unless it was built into every muffler.
b,Right.
%,And that's (( )) . -
sd,"But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle,"
x,<throat_clearing>
+,"had to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,"
ba,"That's a, that's quite a concept."
sv,"You should, uh, pursue that I think, or patent it, <laughter> you know."
aa,"<Laughter> Yeah,"
sd,"patent it,"
sv,that's a good idea.
sv,If you could come up with a device that's the thing.
b,Right.
sv,But it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that.
sd,"But that's a, that's a thought."
%,"No,"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,you're right
sv,"and that will solve, uh, a lot of problems."
sv,"I don't know if you, uh, if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, I guess the proper authorities, -"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"well you might, uh, generate some -- -"
b,"Yeah,"
bf,the automobile regulatory agencies or something.
ny,"-- yeah,"
sv,you might generate some interest in it.
sv,"But that's, that's a good idea."
sv,"Other than that I'm not sure what, what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization."
b,Uh-huh.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
sv,"Uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, I'm sure, like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad."
sv,"Uh, probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies"
sv,and theft and probably murder --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- are the two top ones that we have.
qo,How about you?
h,"Uh, well, I don't actually live in the city,"
aap_am,but I'd probably say that's roughly right.
sv,"I mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life,"
sv,"but I, I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs."
aa,Uh-huh.
sv,"Prob-, probably right, if you look at it from that stand point."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"What, uh, -"
qy,"is there anything, uh, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?"
sd,"Uh, where I live now it's, it's not so bad."
sd,I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it.
sd,"Uh, but I do have friends that live in the city"
sv,"and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing. Uh, just because there are, like, crack houses, you know, on their street and stuff like this."
b,Uh-huh.
qy,"Do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country?"
sd,"I live out in the country,"
%,yeah.
qw,"How far out from the city, I mean, do you, -"
sd,I'm about fifteen miles out.
b^m,About fifteen miles.
sd,"I live in a little suburb, uh, which is, I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- but it's pretty congested.
sd,"We are considered in the country,"
%,Um.
sv,but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.
%,Um.
sv,"Our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, uh, reported."
sv,"However, I'm sure they're there."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed,"
ba,Wow.
+,"sometime during their, their, uh, existence in that neighborhood."
sv,(( That's huge )) .
sd,"And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,sensors and things like that.
sd,"It's cut back, you know, considerably,"
sv,"but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood,"
sv,"so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high."
qy,"Are there, are there any theories on why this is happening?"
sv,"Uh, I would say the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"Most, -"
qw,But why?
qw,Why is it happening?
sd,"Well, most families, most families are young"
sd,and both people are working.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,So they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, so, uh, I would say that's probably their prime motivation."
sv,"They'll, they'll stock your house and, uh, look at your pattern and then go from there."
qy^d,So they're professionals?
na,"Uh, they classify most of them as professionals."
%,Um.
sd,"Uh, you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, uh, just taking, uh, you know, just junk items that they, they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Probably the biggest items that, uh, that you get in our neighborhood, or, would be the high classed automobiles,"
sd,"the, you know, Mercedes, Volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and the jewelry are the major targets,"
sd,"guns, that sort of stuff."
%,Um.
sd,"Very few, you know, penny, penny ante stuff."
qw,"Well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime?"
sv,"Well, uh, the police force, for one,"
sv,"I think they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use."
%,"Uh, it's,"
sv,"oh, right now I think, we are about thirty thousand people"
sd,"and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,for that amount of people --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- which is not very many.
b,Right.
%,"And, -"
sv,"But, I mean, that's going to tend to, -"
sv,"I mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher <ringing>,"
sv,"in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit."
sv,The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place.
%,"Well, the, -"
sd,"course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever,"
sd,"so they're giving the early release, uh,"
b,Right.
sd,"They're doing that in our state, too."
b,"Yeah,"
%,"and, and it's, -"
sd,"I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences, uh,"
%,"but for the, -"
qy,So you think that would be a deterrent?
na,"That would be, certainly be a deterrent."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And, uh, not necessarily, you know, give in to their, uh, human rights desires."
ad,"You know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate. Uh,"
qw,"Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?"
sv,"Uh, I think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty, you know, in a lot of cases."
sv,"Course, I, I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof."
b,Right.
%,"Uh,"
bf,"So you'd, you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody."
aa,"I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"uh, to convict somebody"
sd,"and then those convicted, especially of, you know, murder and, and, uh, you know, major crimes,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"uh, to reach the life sentences and, you know, death penalties and follow-through with that."
%,Huh.
sd,"Uh, especially, you know, in the case of murder --"
b,Right.
sd,"-- uh, I know in my case, I, my wife and daughter were kidnapped,"
ba,"Oh, wow."

ba,"Oh, my goodness."
sd,"-- and we caught, the individuals got caught,"
sd,"we, uh,"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"and, uh, you know, two counts of kidnapping, uh --"
b,Uh-huh.

b,Right.
+,"-- uh, you know, the guy only got five years."
ba,Wow.
sd,"And, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system."

qy,"Did you, did you sue him under the civil system?"
br,Do what now?
qy,Did you sue him under the civil system?
nn,"N-, no."
sd,I'm not real familiar with that.
sv,"Well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right,"
b,Oh.
+,and try to get money from him
%,"and, -"
sd,"Well, the insurance companies and all that tried to, tried to go after him"
sd,"and they said, well, you know, he, they're, he has no job,"
^q,"he has nothing,"
^q,"there's nothing that he has that, that you could go after."
b,Yeah.
sv,"Makes you wish that had, uh, still had indentured servitude, for this sort of thing."
aa,Yeah.
%,"Uh, very seld-, -"
sd,But they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt.
b,Yeah.
sd,They don't do that here.
sd,"Course they pay them,"
%,"but they don't, you don't, -"
sd,you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
b,"Yeah,"
ba,that's too bad.
sd,"And, uh, you know, and they're <ringing>, right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're, you know, they're, they're repeat offenders,"
sd,"they, uh, been in jail before <ringing>,"
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sv,"they've been released, you know, several times, which is another,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"uh, deal I hate to see."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and, uh,"
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"I, I think that's re-, -"
+,"and car theft on top of it,"
b,Yeah.
+,"destroys my car,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"and we're out, you know, uh, you know, fifteen thousand dollars"
sd,"and,"
ba,That's awful <<faint>>.
+,"you know, the guy gets out in two months"
sd,and he goes out and commits it again.
sd,"Fact, he's back in jail now."
%,"So, what, what, uh, -"
sv,Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes.
aa,Yeah.
qh,"What, what deterrent does he really have?"
b,Yeah.
b^m,"Yeah,"
sv,"I think in our, in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real, real possibility."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people --"
ba,"Oh, my God."
sd,"-- and, uh, return offenders have, -"
sd,"they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, you know, particular neighborhood,"
sd,"they'll rob one house,"
sd,"then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try to take it in their own hands."
b,Right.
sd,Course it doesn't always work out in their favor.
b,Right.
sd,"But, uh, nevertheless,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"I think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,"
^q,"you can,"
b,Right.
+,"you know, you can get some of us,"
^q,you can't get all of us.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, and we're beginning to see more and more of that."
sv,"And that, that's a deterrent, too. If you think the home owner might be armed, right, and awake --"
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- here you break in,"
sd,and you're going to get shot.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"that's, I mean that's certainly a possibility in, in, -"
sd,"we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, it helps for a while --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- but then just another different set of people come in,"
sd,"and most of the people are transients from out, outside of the state."
%,Huh.
sv,"Uh, I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in Oklahoma, and Louisiana, Arkansas, you know, across the, the border."
ba,"Wow,"
sd,"So, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,-- it's not many from the local communities.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But, uh, it's a problem,"
sv,"and I, I just, I think that the court systems need to be more accurate in, in, stiffer in their penalties,"
b,Yeah.
sv,would be a definite deterrent
sv,"and,"
b,Yeah.
+,"and, uh, giving the, uh, police, uh, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they, when they catch these people."
aa,Uh-huh.
aa,"I mean, I, I tend to agree with you."
sv,"I think, uh, what I would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes. Uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it --"
b,Right.
+,"-- and, and worry about these things where people are getting hurt."
sv,"And I think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship."
sd,And they lose their constitutional rights.
b,Uh-huh.
+,"You know,"
sv,"and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them."

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"<Swallowing> But, uh, I like to have them where <child_crying> handy."
sd,"Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu-, am-, ammunition."
sv,And I thought that was really good.
sv,"And I think if they, uh, -"
x,<Child_talking>.
sd,"takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition."
sd,You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that.
sd,<Child_talking> I've never heard of anything like that.

x,<Child_crying>.

b,# Yeah

sv,# And # you can get them really cheap.
aa,I know
sd,"I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh, Tennessee."

qw,# How # long was the waiting period out there?
sd,About nine days.
%,Huh.
sv,"That wasn't too, too bad."
aa,No.
aa,No <child_crying>.
sv,"Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it."

sv,"In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day."
%,"Th-, -"
sv,"somebody wants to do that, -"
sv,"I, I, at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms."
aa,Yeah.
sv,"I do too. Uh, because <laughter> it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose."
sd,They both # do the same kind of job. #
sv,# <Dishes> A shotgun hurts worse # than a pistol does.
aap_am,"Uh, yeah."
aap_am,I suppose.
sd,I never got shot with either one.
h,"But I don't know, uh,"
sv,I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun <laughter>.
aa,"No,"
sv,a shotgun's got too much of a spread.
sd,# Or at # --
b,# Yeah. #

sd,"you have a little, uh, thing on the bo-, bottom of th-, on top of the barrel --"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,you can make it either tight or <laughter> as loose as loose can get.
b,Oh.
sd,And the spread changes.
sd,"Uh, <throat_clearing> I've got a manual single shot"
sd,"and I guess it doesn't have any, any automatic features to it."
sd,"The further away I get, the, the, uh, wider the shot gets --"
b,<Child_talking> Yeah.
+,-- from the target.
sd,"And the closer that I get, the tighter that it gets."
sd,It's got a hell of a kick to it.
b,Yeah.
sd,"My husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time."
sd,And I shot <child_crying> that thing one time.
sd,Almost knocked me down.
x,# <Laughter>. #
%,"# And it just (( a li-, )) -"

sv,I think it was a three fifty-seven.
h,I'm not sure.
qy,Do you belong to a gun club or you? -
sd,He belonged to one awhile back.
sd,"Uh, since we moved, -"
sd,we've only been here in Texas for about a year <dishes> --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot. # Just for # --"
ba,# No kidding. #
+,-- target practice.
sd,I'd love to get used to that shotgun.
sd,We traded his pistol for that shotgun.
sd,"Huh. Well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive"
sv,"but, uh, it's well worth it."
sd,"You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition."
sd,"Uh, I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time. Not because I haven't got the desire."
sd,"Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high."
sd,"Plus there's ini-, an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member."
x,<Child>.
sd,So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club.
sd,"Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in."
b,Yeah.

sd,when he was in that gun club where he was doing that <noise> <<can't tell if it's a cough or something was hit>>. -

b,Yeah.

bh,That right.
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"and he, he had all kinds of horror stories."

b,Yeah.

sd,"and I'm, I jus-, I have a hard time dealing with that."
sd,"What I hear one time, I think it was on Paul Harvey's, uh, radio segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"I mean, I was astounded."
sd,I don't even make that.
aa,"No,"
aa,I know.
sd,"I, you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,and somebody's taking that away.
sv,"and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,no doubt.
sv,"You know, it's, it's, it's totally ridiculous,"
sd,"and now, I, I, I, uh, started out when I first got in graduate school"

bh,"Is that right,"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I mean, this is the kind of thing you look at."
b,Yeah.
sd,You sit there
sd,"and when you're writing up budgets, you wonder, okay, how much money do we need."
sd,"Well, you need X number dollars for the recipients"
sd,but you need X number dollars to administer the program.
sv,Well just ridiculous.
b,Yeah.
sv,This is ridiculous.
sv,It's sad.
aa,"It is,"
sv,it's pathetic.

sd,and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance.
b,Yeah.
sd,Give an incentive.
^2,Educational or vocational training or something.
aa,Yeah.
sd,Something that's going to help them along the way.
sv,"And they'll help the country eventually, too,"

b,Yeah.
qh,"I mean, what are we, what are we becoming?"
sv,We're becoming a service country.
bf,As opposed to what we were twenty years ago.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"we were an industrial giant,"
sv,"and now we're no-, we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game."
sd,"We taught them how to do it,"
sv,"and they, they did it better than we do."
b,Yeah
x,<laughter>.
sd,Simple as that.
sv,"because they have the ambition, I guess."
aa,"yeah,"
sd,simple as that.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"which is good for them,"
sv,"but on the other hand, we kind of lose out."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,it's terrible for us.
sv,"I think that if, uh, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition."
b,Yeah.

aa,No.
sv,"They've, they've relinquished their parenting."

b,Yeah.
sv,"Well, as a substitute teacher for a year, I, I can say yes."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I mean, I talked with somebody else about that another time,"
sd,"and, you know, when I's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math, I was, uh, teaching as part of my, part of the program."
sd,And I just love teaching.
sd,"That was a lot, that's probably the most fun I had."
sd,"And, uh, it helped me out because I learned --"
b,Yeah.

b,Uh-huh.

b,Yeah.

b,Yeah.
sd,"I mean, my other pet peeve is unions."
aa,"Yeah,"

^2,And they served a good function.
aa,"And they served a good function,"
