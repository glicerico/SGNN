"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
qw,How do you keep up with current events?
sd,"Um, well actually, usually, uh, in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work, uh,"
sd,usually catch the news in the morning.
b,"Yeah,"
qw,what what channel do you watch or what station?
sd,"Uh, N B C."
sd,That's the one I watch.
sd,I usually keep up with T V.
%,"I don't, -"
sd,I am a student
sd,so I really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't --
b,Yeah.
+,-- too great sometimes <laughter>.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I usually tend to just, you know, rely on, you know, T V, uh, again, you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know like, you know like what today's stories are"
sd,and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I'm interested in any particular one.
b,Yeah.
sd,The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes.
sd,The stations I listen to are just mainly music.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all.
b,Yeah.
qy,"Do you think that T V is, uh, pretty accurate."
qy,I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
%,"or, -"
no,"Well, what I really don't like about T V, especially local news as compared to like national news is just, uh, it seems, it seems like everything is very spoon feed"
sv,"and you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- or like the news, because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports, you know, is your kid's bus driver smoking crack,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"on the way to school, you know?"
b,"Yeah,"
%,it's -
sd,they mainly go with like popular topics --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- just not like basic news.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Also, also I have the observation of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press, you know, which only happened like ten times in my life --"
b,Huh.
+,"-- you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story --"
b,Yeah.
sd,-- it's something wrong.
%,"Going, -"
sv,"they're, looks like they're going more for ratings <noise> than for --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- you know actual news.
sv,"I think, you know the <popping> probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers --"
b,<Tapping> Uh-huh.
sv,-- they typically have a better. -
sd,I am from a small town too here in Texas --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato
%,"and, -"
b,"Yeah,"
^2,the farm report.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,farm report and oil reports.
x,<Laughter>.
ba,That's pretty <tapping> pretty sad
sd,or who killed who.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,<tapping> Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television (( )) .
sd,Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down
%,"and, -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"Well, in, uh, in Dallas, I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's"
sd,"and the story was, uh, -"
qy,"Was that like he started shooting people, people in this cafeteria or something?"
ny,Yeah.
sd,And the news covered it --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- right, you know, hours after it happened"
sd,and they were taping people who were crying who <noise> --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- had everything
sd,"and then like three days later this, uh, local news station was using as as their promo --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- to promote themselves.
sv,"I just thought that was really # that's kind of cold, #"
b,"# Oh yeah,"
sd,I # have seen that happen lots of times.
sd,"You know, uh, Channel X gives you the best coverage <noise>"
sd,you know we were on the scene with our team players
%,"and, -"
b,Yeah
%,"and it was just, -"
sd,they were showing like these dead people --
b,Uh-huh <<very faint>>.
sd,-- and they were showing people crying --
b,Uh-huh <<very faint>>.
sv,-- I mean just taking advantage of you know. -
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"# They are trying to get # the, you know, most emotional response for, -"
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story,"
sd,but just the play on people's emotions <noise>.
%,"It's just gotten so, -"
sv,"I mean, somewhere there's, it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know -- -"
b,Yeah <tapping>.
sv,-- and everything. -
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
sd,"You know, I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know --"
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- uh, <noise> you know even the national news I just find it to be you know --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- very watered down,"
%,"very, -"
qo,What did you think of the coverage of the war?
sd,"Uh, I fou-, I found it very one sided."
bh,Did you?
sv,"Uh, you know, it, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate."
b,Yeah.
h,"Uh, you know, not saying that we shou-, that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,"
sv,"but it just seemed like, you know. -"
sv,"They kept just showing, you know, how great we were doing"
sv,and it never really showed what actually --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- the damage that really happened that's -- -
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the, you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties --"
b,Uh-huh.
%,"-- and they kind of you know, -"
qh,if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- you know got really hurt and everything.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"and I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states, you know that the the military basically sets the press,"
sv,"-ing seems to be a, a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to, uh, catch on, it seems, or maybe a generation to two <laughter>."
sv,And we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up.
sv,"Uh, it does seem to be a lot of habits to break."
sd,"I, uh, wasn't raised as a kid on it,"
sd,but my kids are
sd,"and so they, they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do,"
sd,"and we were doing all right there until, uh, the price dropped out"
sd,<breathing> and they weren't worth anything anymore.
b,Uh-huh.
%,"And we <breathing>, -"
sd,"it took us, <lipsmack> almost a year to get a garbage sack full."
sd,We just don't drink that many.
sd,"So as far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something"
sd,"and, and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in, uh, -"
sd,"at the time it was still, oh, about forty or fifty cents a pound,"
sd,"and we came out with about a dollar <laughter>,"
sv,it just really wasn't worth it.
bf,And a lot of hassle all year round
bf,"and cans laying, -"
aa,Yeah.
b^m,Yeah.
sd,"So, they, they realized, you know, -"
sd,"well, of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old."
sd,"That wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,"
sd,but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it
sd,"and then, uh, T I started keeping up with, uh, cans there,"
sd,so occasionally I'll bring whatever I've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.
sd,"Least it gets back into the system,"
sd,"but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, I haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up."
qy,Have you all got the individual containers yet?
nn,"<Lipsmack> No,"
sd,"I read in the paper this week where maybe, -"
h,"I don't know if it w-, was, -"
sd,I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time.
%,Um.
sd,"But, it, it should be starting, I would stay probably in the next month if, if everything goes that <breathing>, -"
sd,"I'm not sure all what we're going to have to do, whether we have three separate containers,"
sd,I really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything.
b,Right.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"it seemed like, uh, -"
sd,"if, if I recall, it's been a long time."
sv,They're way behind schedule on that particular part of it.
sv,"They were fine on the green, big green containers --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- but, uh, seems like they said they were just going to have a bin"
sd,and all different types would go in there
sd,and then that they would sort it as --
b,Oh.
+,-- as needed.
sv,"It, it seemed that there was, -"
sd,"at the time anyway, it, the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at, at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it, happen to do it pretty well, uh, those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting."
sd,"But when it comes down to just general purpose trash, that all the houses, uh, -"
sd,"the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor,"
sd,"so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than, than --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- having a household try it.
h,"But I, I don't know,"
sv,that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house.
sv,"Well, it would get messy, too."
b,"Yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"I, I, I know other places when they recycle, they have to, like, wash out their glass jars and --"
b,Right.
+,"-- whatnot. And, uh, which we're not in the habit of doing."
aa,That's true.
sd,"I was brought up, uh, you know, long time ago, that they didn't even have cans."
sd,They had bottles
sd,and you'd return them to the --
b,Right.
+,-- the grocery store
sd,and you'd get our money back
sv,"and that, that was all well and good."
sd,They don't seem to still be doing that.
sv,"If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass,"
sd,"but, I guess this day and age --"
b,Yeah.
+,-- they don't.
^2,<Lipsmack> They don't do that.
sd,We live next to a set of railroad tracks
sv,"and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash, you know --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- break them,"
sd,"but, uh, they weren't that successful,"
sd,so there were a lot of bottles to be returned
sd,and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- for the day <laughter>
%,"and, -"
b,"Yeah,"
%,"and they, uh, p-, -"
sv,"I, I think kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,"
sv,they can get more somewhere else.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"just a little bit of begging will <laughter>, -"
%,"Uh, for a good, -"
b,right.
%,"They're, -"
sv,"the nickels, the dimes or what, I <laughter> suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get, they, the kids just don't seem to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money."
b,Right.
%,"Well, I wonder,"
sd,"But, we, we did buy a can crusher"
sd,and we are crushing cans
sd,"and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents,"
sv,so I would say --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before."
sv,"Uh, it was just easier <breathing> to do that than to open a large <breathing> liter bottle and then have it go flat."
b,"Right,"
b,yeah.
sd,"<Lipsmack> So that's the main reason we're, we, sort of are into cans <laughter> at this point rather than the liter bottles <laughter>."
qw,Where do you take your cans?
^h,"Well, as you say, it takes a while to build it up."
sd,"Since we've had the crusher all summer, we <breathing>, I guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta-, oh, -"
sd,"I think the kids, when we were on vacation, they said they did take them to a, a recycling place, probably at one of the li-, -"
ad,"Well, basically, uh, did you want to go first, then?"
aa,"Uh, well, I can."
sd,"I, I don't own my home."
b,"Okay,"
b,right.
sd,"Uh, <laughter> I mean I, I live in a nice area"
sd,and I rent my home
sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- uh, we aren't sure we're going to buy a house yet because we don't know if we're going to be staying here."
b,"Sure,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"In, uh, Texas,"
%,"so, -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"I think as far as, like, our home, it's, uh, in a small residential area."
sd,"We're out of the cities quite a ways,"
sd,so it's kind of more of a country setting
sd,"and, uh, <baby_crying> it's just a typical, uh, three bedroom type of home."
sd,"It's, it's nothing, you know, <baby_crying> elaborate where it has, uh, this or this or, you know."
sd,"It's, it's --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- just a typical home with, uh, three bedrooms, uh, two story type home."
sd,"Uh, and I think as far as if it's, for put it into standards of, uh, what other homes are around here, it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are."
sd,"Uh, there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes"
%,"and yet there's, -"
sd,"where we can view the river from that distance, there's still homes within our area that are, you know, pretty typical of what our home is,"
sd,so --
b,Uh-huh
+,"-- it's, uh, pretty much that, uh, type of, uh, home"
%,"so, -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"Well, our ho-, --"
+,"-- our house, we, we're renting it from an individual who bought it"
sd,and he lives in Korea.
bh,"oh, really?"
sd,"And, uh, <baby_crying> he's recently moved here"
sd,and he's owns eight or nine properties --
b,Sure.
+,"-- uh, near here --"
b,Uh-huh.
%,"-- and, uh, so, -"
b,Yeah.
b,"Oh, yeah,"
b,yeah.
+,"Which is just, uh, in trouble --"
b,Yeah.
+,-- <Breathing> to me.
sd,And they're not very expensive either.
sd,"It just seems like, -"
sd,we have a three bedroom house.
sd,Ours is one level only.
b,Uh-huh.
%,"Uh, but we, -"
qy^d,So it's the rambler style.
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"we have two, two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen"
b,Uh-huh.
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
%,"So, -"
sd,It's kind of like what ours is.
sd,"Uh, one of our bedrooms is really small"
sd,"and we've made that into a den because we only have one child,"
sd,"so that was our best way of going with, uh, the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller."
sv,It seems like they get incredibly small <laughter>.
b,Yeah.
%,"Uh, but, uh, anyway, but, <lipsmack> okay."
sv,"So that sounds great,"
sd,"and, uh, I don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever."
qy,"Have you d-, have you done this before?"
qy,The T I?
ny,Uh-huh.
ny,"Uh, yes,"
sd,"uh, about three times before."
bh,"Oh, have you?"
sd,"I'm fairly new to it,"
sd,but <breathing> it seems to be going okay.
b,Yeah.
qy,Are you in Texas?
nn,"No,"
nn,huh-uh.
b^m,"No,"
b,"yeah,"
nn,"No,"
sd,I'm out of state.
sd,"I'm in Wisconsin,"
%,"so, -"
bh,"Oh, really?"
ny,"Yeah,"
ny,yeah.
b,Oh.
%,"So it's, -"
ba,Sounds interesting.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","<Breathing> Uh, other than that, sure, yeah."
qy,Is this your first time?
nn,"No,"
nn,huh-uh.
sd,"I've, well, I've gotten several calls."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"Uh, but, uh,"
sd,I'm always the one that initiates the calls because I kind of like it because it's like I can get it done with <laughter>.
+,Yeah.
sd,"I don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though I have a feeling what's going to happen is I'll probably get tons of calls, you know, so, sooner or later."
b,"Yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"well, they've, I've talked to some people from Cleveland"
sd,and I did talk to someone --
%,"Uh-, -"
+,-- else who lives here --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- in the same city I do,"
sd,so --
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
+,-- that was kind of interesting <laughter>.
b,"Yeah,"
b,sure.
sv,"They're, they're sure getting their people out,"
fc,"so, well --"
fc,Yeah.
+,"-- it was nice to talk to you, anyway"
fc,"and, -"
fc,"Okay,"
fc,"well, you take it easy, Gail."
fc,"Okay,"
fc,thanks.
fc,"Bye, now."
fc,Bye-bye.
sd,"<static> Well, we're just starting a family through adoption"
sd,"so I don't really have a lot of, uh, concrete, uh, opinions."
sd,"Just what I know out of my peer group, uh, has gone through."
sv,And none of it has been good <laughter>.
bh,"Oh, really?"
ny,Yeah.
sd,"Uh, the ones that can afford to have live-in nannies,"
b,# Huh. #
+,# They # seem to be having an okay time.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, but a lot of the other ones that have, are professional, uh,"
sv,"I'd say fifty percent of, you know, my peers that I'm, in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're, you know, going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"Uh, but I, -"
sv,there must be some good service out there # if you # --
b,# Right. #
+,-- really look and pay for it.
qw,"What, what age child are you thinking in terms of?"
qy^d,In terms of what they're talking about.
nn,No.
sd,"For, for yourselves <static>."
b,Oh.
sd,Infant. Uh ...
bk,"Oh, okay."
b,# Infant. #
sv,"# So you're # starting from the b-, <laughter> from the baseline."
aa,<laughter> Yeah.
sd,"After eleven years of marriage. Yeah, we are."
sd,"We're actually, it's happening now."
sd,"So, we're just going through the process."
b,I see <bird_squawk>.
sd,"So an-, and actually the question is, uh, very appropriate."
sd,"Cause I'm not sure whether, uh, how strong the maternal instinct is going to be."
sd,They tell me it's going to be strong <laughter>.
qy,# Do you # --
b,# Right. #
+,-- have children?
sd,I have one son.
qy,And did you put him in daycare
qrr,or is he older now or younger
%,or? -
sd,"Well, he's, he's now eighteen. And in, in, you know, has completed a couple of years of university."
b,Sure.
sd,So he's out of daycare # <laughter>. #
%,"# I, -"
b,right. #
%,"And, and so that, -"
sd,"but I was working full-time, # uh # --"
b,"# You, -"
b,uh-huh. #
+,-- when he was born.
sd,"But I was very lucky because I was a, a college professor."
b,Oh.
sd,"And so I was able to, you know, #"
sd,"and I, it was # --"
%,# (( Flex )) . # -
+,"-- walking distance from, # from # --"
b,# Yeah. #
+,-- my apartment.
sd,So I went up there
sd,"and I sort of left him with, with a neighbor."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And I left him in a carry cot when he was very little <noise>.
sd,"And I said, you know, he doesn't need anything except, you know, look at him if he cries."
sd,"But, you know, don't pick him up and, # and # --"
b,# Yeah. #
+,-- this sort of stuff.
sd,Because I was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half.
ba,"Oh, that's wonderful."
sd,"And I was able to, you know, get, his schedule just, uh, cooperated."
b,Right.
%,And ... -
ba,That's wonderful.
b,# Yeah. #
b,# Yeah. #
sv,"And, and I guess, uh, th-, because of your, um, your, uh, profession. -"
sd,"I mean, I, uh, I'm in corporate communications."
sd,"But I've done free-lance writing in the past,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"so what we're hoping is that, uh, -"
sd,I mean my husband thinks I can do it.
sd,"I've just never worked out of a domestic base, you know."
sd,# I've always # --
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"-- been in a corporate, uh, environment."
sd,"Uh, but I'm hoping that possibly I can do something where I can go flextime or part-time"
sd,"or if they don't have that, uh, -"
%,"my boss, -"
sd,"I'm very lucky though, again too, my boss is very akin to family building."
sv,"So, I think that's som-, th-, something that couples need # in going # --"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,-- into this.
b,Right.
h,"Uh, I don't know."
sd,I do think there's good daycare out there.
qw,What part of the country are you in?
sd,I'm in Maryland.
sd,You're in # Maryland. #
sd,"# But, # but I was out of the country when, uh, my, my son was little."
sv,"But, but the thing is, if you have this flextime and that, you might be able to do something similar to what I did."
b,# Right. #
+,# Which # is --
sd,That's what I'm hoping.
+,"-- you know, be there short times"
sd,"and then later on when he was, you know -- -"
b,Uh-huh.
%,"-- I mean this, -"
sd,"we're talking about, uh, I went back to work and, or taught some, some classes like a week after he was born."
ba,"Oh, my goodness."
sv,# You were # --
%,# And so # ... -
+,-- fortunate.
b,Yeah.
b,Yeah.
sd,And so that's when # I was # --
b,# Yeah. #
+,"-- saying, you know, don't, don't pick him up and stuff."
sd,But then later what I did was I brought a woman into the house.
b,Uh-huh.
b,Sure.
sd,"And she, she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And then, I also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, you know, in a sense she, she carried him around a lot, too much. Uh, you know --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- for, for my taste."
b,Right.
sv,"It was constantly, no, # I don't want him, #"
x,# <laughter>. #
+,to explore anything.
^q,"He might, uh, he might hurt himself # <laughter>. #"
qy,"# <laughter> # So do you think that, I mean, do you think that that was in a way though, good ob-, good objectivity that, that doesn't really, -"
sd,that's not a correct English #
qy^d,"but (( )) , you know # --"
x,# <laughter>. #
+,"-- in a sense, you see what I'm saying though."
qy^d,"From a mother's standpoint, I mean in a way, i-, it was quote and unquote good ob-, objectivity."
na,"I think it worked out very, very well."
sd,Because what he learned to do by the time he was --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- two or so, he would sit next to the desk where I was grading papers # or # --"
b,# See. # -
+,-- writing lesson plans.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And he had asked for a paper and, you know, sort of scribble"
sd,and then he realized that # there # --
b,# Yeah. #
+,-- were quiet times
sd,and there were active times.
b,Right.
sd,"And then he learned he, he also learned that, uh, there were times that you had to be gone, so you probably minimized, -"
sd,"well we're actually, uh, we're getting ready."
sd,"I mean, you're far enough away now I can tell you <laughter> since this is locally, I make sure, we're going to Romania in a few weeks."
b,Oh.
%,"And that's, uh, # (( just )) . # -"
qy,# Did you # say Romania --
sd,"R-,"
+,-- or Armenia?
+,Romania.
bk,"Oh, okay."
b,"# Yeah,"
b,yeah. #
sd,"# As in, # like, what Twenty Twenty and, uh, but we, we're real excited because we've just developed a contact."
ba,"Oh, good."
+,Through professional people
sd,and it's private
sd,and it's hospital.
sd,"It's, we're just very excited <laughter>."
^h,# Uh # ...
ba,# Oh # great.
+,"And w-, i-, i-, what's the word I'm looking for."
sv,"When you deal with issues like that, uh, in terms of family building through adoption, uh, and then you have people responding to you, well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare."
bd,Oh # that's silly. #
sd,"# Uh, # issues are being raised prematurely in my mind."
sd,But I guess they're not because it's something I'll have to deal with sooner than later.
sd,"Uh, and I, what I've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion."
sd,"I feel that if the child is healthy, uh, and as long as we make it feel secure, I'd love to do something like with what you did."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, I don't think I could be dumper where I could take it from, you know, eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there."
b,Right.

ar,"No,"
sd,I was in the Middle East.

sv,"Well, that's the same thing."
h,I mean I don't know how they are there
sd,"but, uh, in eastern Europe, -"
sd,"my stepfather's from England,"

b,Uh-huh.

ba,"See, I think that's wonderful."
sd,"And, I mean, that was recently after my son, <laughter> was going off."

sd,"in a sense, I went to work"
sd,and she was at home alone some of the time.

b,Yeah.

sv,what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
sv,but you can probably empathize with this.
sd,It's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts <laughter>.
b,"Right,"
b,right.
sd,"In terms of what to do. Uh,"
sv,"and I just don't think there is a day, a good daycare system."
sd,"Uh, my company, I'm particularly fortunate that they have, they're in tune with that."
sd,"But I've been at companies where, uh, you know, the, deci-, the, the trend is, or the definite mood is, well we made conscious decisions not to have children."
%,You know.
%,"And in, -"
sd,"and a couple like us building through adoption, there, it's almost radical to some people."
sd,And what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
sd,"and, uh, I respect, there are some women that I know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they, you know, they may have the need for child care like that."
b,Uh-huh.
ba,"But I agree with you, that it's just, I call it dumping <laughter>."
b,Yeah.
%,"I, # I # ... -"
b,"# No,"
sv,"# I, I think that certainly there is a role, uh, for this type of help."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And, and as long as one can, can supervise it and, and, you know, make it work in, into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or --"
b,Uh-huh.

^2,"Then, yeah,"
sv,"# it's ar-, # --"
+,-- in tandem then.
b,"Yeah,"
b,# yeah
x,<noise>. #
%,"# I just, # uh, -"
sd,and there are trade-offs too I think.
sv,"One of the things that is a problem is that, uh, in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, it's just, you know, it's so low"
sd,"but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis, it's prohibitive."
sd,And some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year --
b,Yeah.

sd,"Actually, there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood."

b,# Really. #

%,"Uh, I, -"
sv,maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids.
b,Sure.
sd,"But, and they, they take care of another child"
sd,"and I, I can actually n-, could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"# And they, -"
b,yeah. #
sv,# <swallowing> And I mean that's # another possibility
sv,"and, you know, you might want to stay home one year"
sv,"and some other lady might want to stay home for a, a few years"
%,and ... -
sd,I haven't thought about that.
b,Yeah.
sd,And actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
sd,and she's at home part-time paralegal.
%,"So I'm thinking, um -"
x,# <laughter>. #
b,"# Yeah,"
b,yeah. #
sd,And we get along fantastically
%,"so I'm thinking, you know. -"
sv,"And that's the way you have to, uh, -"
%,"how wa-, -"
sd,I'm just real curious.
qo,How was the Middle East in terms of that with children?
qy,"Is that, is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them?"
nn,No.
sd,"Well, actually there was a daycare center, uh, where my son did go for a year."
sd,I think from when he was two to three.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,But then he actually started kindergarten at age three.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And so, and i-, you know, it wasn't like prekindergarten,"
sd,it was real kindergarten.
b,"Oh, really."
sv,He must be # smart.
b,Yeah. #
aa,# Yeah.
sd,"So he, # he was ready to, to go to school at that point."
b,Uh-huh.
ny,"But, yeah,"
sd,"they're, they do have such facilities."
sv,"But for the most part, uh, th-, with the extended family, you know, you can usually find somebody. Which is much like our neighbor --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know, to, sharing responsibility."
sd,"And I'm, and also there aren't that many women who, who d-, # who work. #"
sd,# The professional. #
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I was wondering about # that. #
b,# Yeah. #
%,"Uh, there, -"
sd,I'm in Dallas
sd,"and there was just a very big, uh, series about Moslem women"
sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts.
sd,I'm digressing here
qy^d,"but, uh, I was just real curious when you said Middle East, # if you # --"
b,# Yeah. #
+,-- didn't mind me asking.
nn,"No,"
nn,no.
sd,And I didn't mean Israel.
qy^d,"So # you, you assumed right <laughter>. #"
nn,"# Oh, no"
bd,that's okay <laughter>.
sd,"# Well, even if you did, that's okay actually."
%,# I think # ... -
arp_nd,"# Well, no #"
sd,"because at first thought, when I s-, you know, I said that not many people work, I'm, I'm thinking oh, well she's going to, you know, because certainly in Israel the women do work # <laughter>. #"
b,# Right.
b,Right.
sd,"They fight,"
sd,they work. #
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
b^m,Okay.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,I forgot all about that that it had to be pressed.
x,<Laughter>.
%,"Um, but anyway, so, so as far as, -"
sd,"w-, we really, we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of T V --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- because we both were raised, you know, that way, you know, where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a T V to be the baby-sitter."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And we just don't want that.
sd,"We want more communication and interaction, you know, amongst us as a family."
sd,"And we both like sports,"
sd,"so we figured, well what, what better way to get out and, you know, be together as a family --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and also, you know, have it be good for you."
sd,"And plus, we like, we both like to cook,"
sd,"so, you know, that's something we spend time together too, is, you know, cooking and, uh, preparing meals and stuff."
sd,"So, uh, but as far as that <laughter>, that's about all we've discussed # as far as for family. #"
b,"# Really,"
b,"okay,"
sd,"well see, # I'm the third oldest of twelve children."
x,(( )) .
ba,Oh my gosh.
%,"So like I said, I, -"
sd,and I'm only twenty-one.
sd,I'll be twenty-two next month.
sd,So there's nine that are younger than me.
sd,My youngest sister is five.
b,Oh yeah.
sd,"And like I sa-, I don't have any children."
sd,"I'm just engaged,"
sd,"and I'm getting married in October,"
sd,and we haven't discussed this at all <laughter>. Um.
b,"Yeah,"
qy^d,"long way down the road, right."
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,exactly.
sd,"But, um, now I've noticed that like, while I'm at college, and when I go home, my bro-, you know, my, -"
sd,"I'm really close to the younger ones,"
sd,"and, um, like, when, when, like when I do go home they enjoy just laying around me, you know,"
sd,"like if we do watch T V at night, they just like enjoy just, like laying on top of me or something."
b,Yeah.
sd,They like that.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"But, um, as far as that goes, like we play games,"
sd,"I play like Old Maid and Fish with them,"
sd,"and w-, we play board games,"
%,"and when it's ni-, -"
sd,"like I'm from Pennsylvania,"
sd,"so when it's nice out, we go outside,"
sd,and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And in the summer everyone is like, I think there's like seven of us still at home,"
sd,"and all seven are in a sport,"
sd,like also (( )) the girls are in softball
sd,and the boys are in baseball.
sd,"So all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports,"
sd,"that's it, you know."
%,"Well do you, do you, -"
qy,"so you go, if you're, if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters' or brothers' --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- sporting events.
ny,Yes.
+,And sort of like be there with them.
na,"Right,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,we go and watch.
b,Yeah.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Well, that's, that's good, too, I mean, as far as entering,"
sv,"I mean, you're, you're participating,"
sv,"but you're not, you know."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,I mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff
%,"and that's, -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"because, um, even if our kids, you know, get into sports that we're really not interested in, I don't, I want them, you know, to know that we're still there --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- so to speak, as a family."
sd,"Well, it's funny because, um, well, my mom and dad both were kind of athletic."
sd,"They both grew up on a farm,"
sd,"but although, you know, it wasn't them playing I notice like whenever I was playing softball and such, my mom and dad got into it more than I did."
sd,"I mean, they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling, # you know,"
%,so. # -
b,# Yeah.
bf,Cheering you on and stuff. #
sv,"A lot of times the parents get into it just as much as, as the kids,"
sd,"and I found, like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff, it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu-, you know, get into fights, who can scream louder, and you know, everything."
sd,"So it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it,"
sd,and they're not really even participating.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"well, that, that would be fun."
bf,"Boy, so you, you have a lot of experience as far as, you know, different ways a family can interact and, and do things together,"
aa,Yeah.
+,"as far as, -"
%,"go-, -"
%,twelve.
aa,Uh-huh.
%,But it's -
%,"so, if you're not, -"
%,"i-, -"
%,"what if, -"
qy,do people go off in their own little groups with that many?
qy,"I mean, did like some people go to their rooms and (( )) , -"
ny,"Yeah,"
%,"it's, um, -"
sd,"the, the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real-, we really don't have any privacy when we're at home, because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms."
b,Yeah.
sd,"But, um, like I say, you know, I'm twenty, I'll be twenty-two next month,"
sd,and I'm closer to the younger kids than I am the ones my own age.
sd,"And that's, I think,"
b,Huh.
+,"that's because we-, the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do,"
sd,"and the younger kids are at home,"
sd,and I like to spend time with them.
b,Yeah.
qw,"But when you were growing up and they weren't, and the younger ones weren't around, what did you do?"
arp_nd,We were all pretty close when we were younger.
bk,"Oh, I see."
qy^d,"But now that they've all sort of moved off, -"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"now that we're getting older, people are get-, you know, each one of us are going our own direction."
b,Yeah.
b,Uh-huh.
%,"So, do you think, even, -"
qw,"I mean, what did you do when you were younger,"
qy,"did you go do the board games and stuff,"
qy,you still did what you do now.
ny,"Oh, yeah."
sd,"And, um, we, you know, we had blocks and stuff,"
sd,"and <laughter> we just did, we would make, -"
sd,"like in the winter when it wa-, -"
sd,we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- we, uh, <laughter> we would, um, <laughter> clear out our basement,"
sd,"and we would like, do, just, even stupid things,"
sd,"like we try hurtling our couches and stuff. You know, and. -"
qy^d,Hurling.
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,we would just run and jump over the couches.
bk,"Oh, hurtle,"
bk,"oh, okay."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"to see who could jump over, you know."
sd,We just made up our own stupid little games.
sd,"And like hide and seek,"
sd,"well, we have a, a bigger house than a lot, you know,"
sd,our house isn't the average small one.
sd,So we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that.
bf,"So you, you had a lot of games and things you played --"
aa,Yeah.
+,"-- even when you were kids with the ones that you, -"
sd,"Well see, they're, um, we're all, like we're all pretty close together."
sd,"Like, m-, my sister that's closest to me, we're only fourteen months apart."
b,Yeah.
sd,"So there was always, there was never just one alone, you know."
b,"Yeah,"
bf,"no, not real spread in age."
aa,Right.
sd,"So we were all pretty close where we, we always had a buddy to play with,"
b,Yeah.
+,you know.
ba,"Gosh, twelve,"
qy,"is that, is that pretty common up there, uh, in, -"
nn,"No,"
nn,"no,"
sd,not at all.
bk,"Oh, okay."
sd,Not at all <laughter>.
sd,"I don't meet, I mean, I don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more."
sd,I mean --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- my, my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen,"
sd,"but, I mean, that's his mother --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know,"
sv,"and, and their Catholic *they're"
%,"and, I mean that's, -"
b,"Well, yeah,"
sd,I'm Catholic <laughter>.
sv,"Well that's it then, I think,"
sv,"probably maybe that, that. -"
b,Uh-huh.
qy,"But, I mean, do you see yourself having thirteen kids --"
nn,"No,"
sd,not at all.
+,-- or twelve kids?
sd,Not at all.
b,Yeah.
sd,"But, see, um, when I was younger I used to say that I would like to have five."
sd,"Well, I've even cut that down now,"
sd,"and, um, but to me five wasn't even a lot, because I was just so used to twelve."
b,Yeah.
b,You know.
sv,"<Laughter> But it's so expensive, man."
aa,"But, yeah,"
sv,"it's so, it would be really hard now to have twelve children."
sv,"I would think for your parents it would be, it would still be hard even nowadays, I mean, just to raise twelve kids."
sd,"Well,"
sv,"Would be, shoosh."
+,"Well, okay, well like my oldest brother, he's, he's twenty-four,"
sd,"and he put himself through college,"
sd,"and, um, there's a sister older than me,"
sd,"she's still living at home,"
sd,but she works --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know,"
sd,"and I think she even gives mom and dad a little bit, you know, of rent money."
b,Yeah.
sd,"And I'm putting myself through college,"
sd,"and like I'm getting married in October,"
sd,and my fianc3e and I are paying for most of the wedding.
sd,"And then, then my brother right behind me, he moved out,"
sd,"and he has an apartment,"
sd,"and he works,"
sd,"and then the next one down is in the Marines,"
sd,and he's out of the house.
sd,"So, it's kind of like they don't, you know. -"
sv,"Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though, you know."
sv,I mean --
aa,"I, I think they do."
+,-- you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody --
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- so you, you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself,"
aa,Exactly.
+,if you really want it.
sd,"Like, uh, well, I find it a lot when I'm up here at college because I've always had a bank account,"
sd,I've always had my own checking account since I was in like tenth grade.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"You know, I would work in the summer,"
sd,"and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or, you know,"
b,Yeah.
+,"to, to manage money."
sd,"Like my roommate's <laughter> laughing at, you know, at me, you know, # because their schooling's paid for. #"
%,"# Or manage money or know, -"
%,"# yeah,"
qh,"know, you know, how to get, how to even go about getting money."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,uh-huh.
qh,"You know, how to get a job or you know, just what, you know, what, when you get a job, what your responsibility is."
b,Yeah.
qh,"Are you going to blow all that money,"
sv,how easy it is to blow money you earn.
aa,Yeah.
sd,"And see, and then, my mom and dad, like whenever, like we would go out and we would get a summer job, -"
sd,"and then we would start blowing money,"
sd,"and my mom said, well that's stupid for you to be blowing money."
sd,"She goes, okay if your going to blow your money on other things, she goes, you can just pay for your life insurance."
sd,"So then we, when we all graduated from hi-, college, from high school,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"we all got, -"
sd,"we're still, like I'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because I'm still in school,"
sd,"but I have my own policy, too."
%,"So I had a poli-, -"
sd,"you know, my mom and dad got it set up, you know, you know, helped me to get it and everything,"
sd,"and I have my own policy,"
sd,and then I pay for my own life insurance too.
sv,"Wow,"
sd,And then --
+,you've really got responsibilities.
+,"-- And then, like, my mom and dad, because there's so many of us, and because of the way the laws are, you know, now, if we want to drive, we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Because my mom said, that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it,"
sv,"if we were in a wreck, you know, you can be sued for anything now."
sd,And she said that's really not fair to the younger kids.
sv,If we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued -
sv,"and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad,"
sv,and the little kids would have nothing.
aa,"And I, I agree with her."
h,"You know, I just, I don't know."
b,Yeah.
%,"Wh-, -"
sd,"So if, you know, if we want to drive, we pay our own insurance,"
%,and. -
sv,"So really, I think, sometimes there's an advantage,"
sv,"I mean, sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,It makes you know that you can't take anything for granted --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- that when you get something you're lucky to get it, so to speak --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- you know.
h,"So, um, I don't know,"
%,"sometimes, -"
sv,"but now, it, it is hard, I can imagine, on your parents, you know ..."
ad,Why don't you tell me about your choir.
b,Oh.
x,<Throat_clearing>.
aa,"Okay,"
sd,"well, we, uh, are a group of, uh, musicians that just kind of have, you know, formed out of a desire to sing"
sd,"and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, or just real talented I should say."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching. Uh,"
%,"others have, -"
sd,"there's one gal that's in the, uh, Plano Community Orchestra. Uh, <lipsmack>"
sd,"just, you know, different backgrounds."
sd,It's been really kind of interesting.
ba,Great.
%,"So, -"
sd,"Uh, I play the piano --"
b,Um.
sd,"-- and, uh, I have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano."
sd,"He does that, uh, musically, listens"
sd,"and then he can play, which is kind of interesting."
b,"Oh, yeah."
sv,"I think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, <lipsmack> my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at Music Man."
bh,"Oh, they did?"
qy,"Yeah,"
sd,and that's --
qw,"How did,"
+,-- lots of fun.
+,How did they get involved in that?
sd,"Uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions."
sd,It was the Plano Repertory Theatre.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And so they went and tried out
sd,and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man
sd,and my son played one of the children in a band.
ba,"Oh, how fun."
aa,"So, yeah,"
aa,"it was really fun,"
sd,"and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school,"
sd,"and my daughter takes piano lessons, too."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, uh, we just really like music."
sd,"It's a, I, I especially like it as an outlet when the T V goes off,"
sd,we <laughter> --
b,"Um, uh-huh,"
b,um.
+,-- get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music.
b,"Yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
ba,that's nice.
qy^d,You say have your four year old taking lessons already?
ny,Uh-huh.
qw,"And, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from?"
sd,"Uh, I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki."
b,Uh-huh.
+,Which is an auditory type learning experience.
sd,"You listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear-, by hearing the intervals and things like that."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I teach, uh, <lipsmack> like what is traditionally taught, you know,"
sd,you look at the note on the page
sd,"and you play what's on the piano,"
sd,but he can't learn like that.
sd,He's a delayed child.
sd,"He's only about, I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things."
b,Oh.
sd,"And, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand,"
sd,"we went, wow --"
b,Uh-huh.
^q,"-- we better have him do s-, do something."
b,Yeah.
+,"You know, educationally."
b,Yeah.
sd,So that was really fun.

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Well, I have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five --"
b,Um.
sd,"-- because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much"
sd,"and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play"
sd,and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally.
%,"She just, -"
sv,"Oh, I think that's great."
sd,So I wasn't sure when to start her.
sd,"I didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene."
sv,"That's really hard I think, because, especially if you start them"
sv,and then they get pretty good
sv,"and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something,"
sv,"they go, I don't want to do this anymore"
sv,and you're like --
b,Uh-huh <laughter>.
+,"-- God, I really want <laughter> you to do it."
b,Yeah.
qh,You know.
b,Yeah.
sv,"So sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when,"
h,"but, I don't know,"
ad,if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.
aa,"Uh-huh,"
aa,uh-huh.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"I think she'd like to,"
%,"I just don't know if it's really, -"
sd,"knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot"
sd,"and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,It was something easily forgotten.
sd,"So, uh, I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight"
sd,"or, or should I say seven."
sd,"I mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally."
sd,"She does have to really work at it,"
%,"but, uh, so, -"
sd,That's like me.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"but, so I'm kind of, you know, just playing with it,"
sd,"but at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway"
%,"but, -"
sv,"Well, it can get expensive --"
b,Yeah.
sv,-- that's for sure.
b,Yeah.
sd,"I, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the Suzuki method --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- without paying a lot out.
ba,"Oh, that's good."
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,so it's been good for our family.
qy,"Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method,"
qy,have you had any former Suzuki students?
ng,"I don't have any Suzuki students. Uh,"
qw^d,"I was wondering how, -"
sd,"Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will al-, -"
qy,"Well, do you have any pets?"
ny,Yes
sd,I do.
sd,"I have a dog named Grisly, who's a ten year old, uh, mixed breed between Golden Retriever, Afghan Hound and Chow."
bk,Oh.
sd,And I have a pair of box turtles.
bk,"Oh,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"I used to have box turtles, um, well, years ago, when I was growing up --"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"-- I, I really like them."
b,"Oh, yeah,"
sd,"I do, too."
sd,"Lucky and Spot, that's their names --"
b,Oh.
sd,"-- and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room,"
sd,"and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"and always has his nose all around my turtle box,"
qy,so do you have any pets now?
ny,"Yes,"
sd,"um, we have one dog, a Bichon Frise."
sd,"Um, our friends in Houston bred the dogs."
sd,I had never heard of them --
nn,"No,"
sd,I haven't either.
sd,"-- they're, um, they're all white"
sd,"and they're small, and, um, and fluffy,"
sd,they don't shed.
sd,"I guess they're distantly related to a poodle,"
sd,"but they're not very well known in this country,"
sd,"and they're not, um, high strung or over bred --"
b,Oh.
+,-- um.
qw,And how big do they get.
sd,"Ours is, uh, on the small end,"
sd,"and she's about ten pounds,"
sd,and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds --
ba,"Oh, that's interesting."
sd,"-- and they love people, um, and kids"
sd,"and that was something we were looking for, um,"
sd,"our, our love is Golden Retrievers,"
sd,"and that's what we had intended to get in Houston,"
sd,but we had a small yard and a pool
sd,and knowing how they love to dig --
%,"Ye-, -"
sv,"the water,"
%,yes.
+,"-- and love the water, um, and we thought that was kind of a tough climate --"
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- so, uh, we ended up getting this,"
sd,"and, uh, my son would rather have a Golden Retriever, though, I think <laughter> --"
b,Oh.
sd,"-- now he wants a, a good size dog <laughter>."
b,"Uh-huh,"
sd,"well, we've got a good size dog,"
sd,"and we were considering getting a puppy, a small house, lap top dog for him, because he likes other animals and for me, because we used to have a miniature Dachshund,"
sd,and I miss --
b,Oh.
+,-- having a little one --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, around."
ba,"The kind you have sounds very interesting, though."
sd,"Well, they really are, um, they're really sweet dogs."
sd,"We've, uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and, and bred them."
sd,"They had five litters of puppies,"
sd,and --
b,Oh.
+,-- and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood --
b,Uh-huh.
%,"-- because, um, -"
qw,And how do you spell that breed?
sd,It's B I C H O N F R I S E.
b^m,F R I S E.
qw,And how do you pronounce that?
sd,Bichon Frise.
bk,Okay.
sd,"I'm writing it out phonetically,"
b,Yeah.
%,"They're, uh, -"
sd,and they don't shed
sv,"so they're, they're good dogs for people with, with --"
b,"Yes,"
+,"-- allergies,"
sd,"and they love people,"
%,"and they're, -"
qy,Do they bark a lot?
nn,"Um, no,"
sd,not really.
sd,"Ours, um, ours barks more than, um, than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends' house."
sd,We used to swap back and forth dogs.
sd,(( )) they have three dogs.
sd,"They had a Cockapoo, and, and two Bichons --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- um,"
sd,and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there --
bk,Oh.
sd,"-- and, uh, now it's funny."
sd,"She's, she's a good watch dog --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and if there's, she'll bark that way,"
sd,"but she also talks a lot,"
sd,she --
b,Yes.
+,"-- um, has a definite personality"
sd,"and so, if we're leaving her, she barks at us, because --"
b,Oh.
+,-- she doesn't want to be left. Um.
qy,Does she ever mess in the house?
nn,"No,"
nn,"no,"
sd,"and they're, um, they're very smart dogs."
sd,The circuses in Europe used to use them --
b,Oh.
+,"-- um, for the acts."
sd,"They, uh, oh, they'll dance --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- on their hind legs each --
ba,"Oh, gee."
sd,"-- um, but they're very easy to train --"
b,Uh-huh.
%,"-- and, -"
qw,And about how much are they?
%,"Well, they range, -"
^h,I'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper.
sd,"They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, I think --"
qw,"And how about the,"
+,-- which I thought was a lot.
+,"And how about the person in, uh, Houston?"
arp_nd,"Well, she's no longer breeding them --"
bk,Oh.
sd,"-- but, um, because her dogs, um, the, the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter,"
sd,"and, uh, the one male that she used had a tooth problem --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and so she only bred that dog once because it had --
b,"Oh, yes."
+,"-- the tooth problem, and did them strictly as, um, pets, you know --"
b,"Just pets,"
+,"-- they weren't, weren't show quality."
b,"Yes,"
sd,"that's what we'd rather have is just a pet, instead of -- -"
b,"Ri-, -"
sd,-- we used to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl.
sd,"We did that every weekend,"
sv,"Oh, but, yeah, takes a lot of time."
aa,"Yes,"
sv,and it's very expensive.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"um, but she might have some contacts here,"
sd,"I know origina-, I know that the dog's grandmother, um, was from Plano,"
sd,"Oh, that's where I live,"
sd,"Oh, that's where I live, too."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I'm at Coit and Legacy ... -
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","So I own a, a P C A T at my home."
b,"Uh-huh,"
sd,"I could never justify owning a personal computer at home, uh,"
sv,"I mean, that's quite an expense to look for, uh,"
qw,"well, who is this,"
qo,what do you use yours at home for?
arp_nd,"Well, that's actually a good question."
sd,"My wife works out of the home, our home."
sd,She has an office
sd,and in fact she sits in the office
sd,and she uses it to compose and print out letters.
bk,"Okay,"
%,well now. -
sd,So that's a very regular use of it that she has.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And in addition to that I tinker around with it.
sd,I'm a computer scientist.
bk,Oh.
sd,And so I write programs to do little things
sd,I'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special.
sd,And also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like.
sd,"Uh, huh, well, <throat_clearing> excuse me, I, uh, uh, well I'm a technician, electronics tech."
sd,"Years ago T I sent me to their, uh, computer school down in Austin."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So, uh, I learned to repair one"
sd,but you know I never really learned to operate one.
sv,"Oh, that's a key thing."
%,"Well, actually that's a, -"
sv,there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today.
aa,Yes.
+,That just require no programming.
%,"So that yo-, -"
sv,in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming
sv,"but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,But I think you you really hit the nail on the head.
sv,For the average person is exactly what he can use it for.
sv,And if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters
sv,"or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the <<pause>> nuts and bolts in your garage,"
sv,whatever
sv,"there, your issue is then there really, -"
sd,"Well, uh, space is a handicap with me,"
sd,I live in a motor home.
b,"Oh, I see"
%,well. -
sd,And I'm preparing for retirement.
b,I see
ba,"well, congratulations on that."
sd,And I'm not to far from it another year and a half.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"well, actually one other thing I might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap."
aa,"Yes,"
aa,"definitely,"
sv,but just like the computers.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, remember how they started out running three, four hundred dollars."
b,Right.
bf,"Oh, the calculators you mean."
na,"I mean ca-, calculators,"
fa,I beg your pardon.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,they sure do.
aa,Yeah
sd,I actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum.
sv,You can actually buy a whole <throat_clearing> brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars.
bh,You're kidding.
nn,No.
qy,Including a printer?
arp_nd,"Well, actually I wasn't including a printer,"
sd,but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars
sd,so make it seven hundred.
qy,A hundred?
ny,Yeah.
ba,"Wholly smoke,"
qy,a respectable one?
ny,"Yes,"
ny,uh-huh.
sd,"Well, see of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them,"
sd,"but I'm, I'm, that does amaze me."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"the prices had plummeted,"
sd,"you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# the # box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty, eighty-eight, for about two hundred dollars."
b,Huh.
sd,"And then the keyboard is another fifty,"
sd,the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred
sd,and then the disk drive is two fifty.
qy,"Well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive."
arp_nd,"Well, that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now,"
sd,"you're buying these knock offs,"
%,"so there's, -"
sd,probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"It's a big magazine,"
sd,"it's twelve inches acro-, narrow, the narrow side and --"
ba,"Oh, wow."
+,-- seventeen inches the tall side
sd,and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.
sd,"But the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses"
sd,and they're all competing with each.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So you just flip through there until you find a <smack> eighty, eighty-eight computer <breathing>"
sd,"that that's called, it's the original P C."
%,"So it's, -"
sd,"we call the T I, I'm sorry an I B M P C compatible."
sd,And you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me.
b,Uh.
sd,And you mix and match
sd,and then you do it by mail-order.
sd,But there's no real brands
sd,"it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board."
bk,I see.
qo,How do you go about getting one of those a catalogs?
sd,"They're available in, you know, the B Daltons, that that type of thing."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"You'll notice that in that it's, it's a, it's a, although it's a magazine it's large."
sd,And like I said it's about an inch thick <breathing>.
b,"Uh-huh,"
sd,"well, getting back to the P C -s,"
^h,"I'll tell you,"
%,"I ya, -"
sd,first of all I don't like a machine that's smarter than me.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"And secondly, I did learn this much about computers,"
sd,they they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,In binary.
aa,That's right <breathing>.
ba,There's great.
sd,"Well, anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes."
b,"Oh, yeah <laughter>."
sd,One and one equals ten.
b,"Yeah,"
b,that's great.
sv,"Course it's it's kind of an inside joke, you know."
b,Yeah.
sv,You can only tell that to somebody who understands binary.
ba,"<Laughter> I understand,"
ba,"that's great,"
ba,that's a good joke.
%,"So what, -"
qy,"do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at T I?"
na,I did for years
sd,and then I was a scientist over in central research labs
sd,and just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, now I I type that one,"
sd,but I don't use it anymore.
b,"Uh-huh,"
sd,well I just recently started using one.
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# In # connection with my work.
b,Yes.
sd,"Uh, I keep track of an inventory here."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,And of course now that is where a computer is very handy.
aa,"Yes,"
aa,I agree.
sd,"And, well I, it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated."
b,"Oh, yeah."
sd,See I'm with the Q R A lab.
b,"Oh, I see"
ba,that's fascinating.
+,Qualification and evaluation
sd,"so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,# and # they're dated.
sd,"So I have to keep up with them, uh,"
sd,and and it's very handy doing it on the computer.
b,Yeah.
sd,I just run a printout every week
sd,"and and it puts me right up-to-date what I'm, what I have to do, what I have to ship, what I should be expecting to be returned."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"So a, -"
sd,it it is handy.
b,Right.
sd,"And I must admit that up until I did start using one, uh, it was, I had very little interest in computers."
b,Yes <noise>.
sv,But they are amazing.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,they certainly are.
^h,"So let's see, see"
sv,"so I guess with respect to the question, -"
%,"yeah,"
sv,I guess we've kind of covered it.
aa,I think we did.
ba,"Great,"
fc,nice little conversation with you Jack.
fc,"Yeah,"
fc,Mike you take care now.
fc,# Good day. #
fc,# Good luck # to you.
fc,Thank you.
fc,Same to you.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
b,"All right,"
sd,"well, I'm not a big exerciser,"
sd,but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And so basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker."
sd,"I am, too."
bh,Are you?
ny,Yes.
sd,"I don't do that, oh, I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- keep their arms up.
sd,I don't do that.
sd,"I mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby"
sd,"or, you know, and I have to do that at least once a day. If it,"
ba,"Oh, that's good."
+,"If it's going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did before."
sd,I can't neglect that because of the baby either.
qw,And how old is your baby?
sd,"She just, uh, well, she was premature,"
sd,"so she's about nine months now, though."
sv,"Goll-, times goes fast."
aa,Yes.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night."
ba,"Oh, that's great."
sd,My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and he lost sixty-two pounds --
x,<Breathing>.
sd,-- and I lost twenty-one.
ba,"Oh, my goodness."
sd,"<Lipsmack> So we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program"
sd,and we walk our dog every night --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- and go up around the elementary school.
sd,We have a little path that we do.
b,Uh-huh.
+,"And, uh, except if it's raining or real cold --"
b,Yeah.
+,-- which it hasn't been --
b,Exactly.
sd,"-- we try to get out, uh, every, every night."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And he plays racquetball twice a week,"
sd,"but I'm not into that,"
sv,so --
x,<Laughter>.
+,-- I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.
sv,"Well, I think that is just wonderful."
sd,"Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children"
sv,"and so, uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task."
aa,Yes.
sd,"You know. Uh, it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go, oh, this is wonderful,"
^q,let's go <laughter>.
aa,"Right <laughter>,"
aa,that's right.
sd,I know my kids are into sports
sd,"and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty"
sd,so we will just go out after that.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk."
b,Yeah.
qy,"Now, does your husband usually go with you, then?"
ny,Yes.
ba,"Oh, see, now that's really nice."
aa,Yes.
sd,Because mine's at meetings sometimes
sd,"and, and he's not really into it"
%,so --
%,No --
+,"-- I have to, -"
sd,-- my husband never was either until he lost the weight.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,That was his decision.
sd,He had arthritis in his hips
sd,and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise.
sv,I think that is so wonderful.
sd,"So once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night."
sd,And our dog has lost a little weight.
sd,"He walks every night, too <laughter>."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes."
ba,I bet.
sv,"I think that's really, really good."
sv,"And, and, you know, I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine."
aa,Yes.
%,"It's not, -"
sd,"like when I first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was --"
^2,Making time for it.
+,-- to get ready and get out there.
sd,"But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a <laughter> ... -"
b,Yes.
sd,"You know. And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me"
sd,and sometimes they don't.
sd,"And when they don't, I, I really notice, you know, how fun it can be when they come."
sd,"So, uh, I like to have somebody come with me."
aa,"I know,"
sd,"I do, too."
sd,"Uh, I know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home --"
b,Right.
+,-- around this block area.
sd,"So it, it's not real dangerous,"
sd,"but still, I don't like to go alone."
aa,No.
%,So <<faint>>. -
sd,I never do either. Even if I have my dog with me.
b,Yeah.
aa,"You know, it's nice to have another person there,"
%,but ... -
aa,Yeah.
%,"You know,"
sd,"Mostly, it's my husband"
sd,and sometimes it's my kids.
sv,"Well, I think that's great."
sd,"I, and, well, sometimes when I, I take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise I, I really think I do."
sd,I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, I found real quick that wasn't for me."
sd,"Me, too."
sd,I did the dance step when I lived up in --
b,Uh-huh <<very faint>>.
+,-- Michigan
sd,and it just wore me out.
sd,I would leave totally exhausted.
sd,"I never lost any weight,"
sd,and I got to the point I dreaded going in.
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
sd,So walking seems to be a good solution for me
sd,and it doesn't cost anything <laughter>.
aa,"Right <laughter>,"
aa,right.
sd,And it gives me time to think.
sd,"So I think, not only does it help my body,"
sd,but I think it helps my mind --
aa,Yes.
+,-- too.
sd,So I like that.
sd,That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- without having the kids jump in and ... -
aa,"Yeah,"
^2,need something
%,"and, -"
aa,Yep.
sv,They can wait until you get back home.
aa,Yep.
sv,"Well, I think that's great <lipsmack>."
sd,"Well, that's what I do for <laughter>, -"
b,"Yep,"
sd,"that's all I do, too."
b,Okay.
b^m,Okay.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Yeah,"
qw,"the question was, uh, what kind of books do you read for entertainment, uh, uh, <laughter> I guess,"
sd,"Oh, I just read for escape."
bk,Okay <laughter>.
%,"Well, I mean it's, -"
ba,With two little kids I can understand that.
b,Yes.
sv,It's that's simple.
sd,"I read to escape,"
sd,and I don't read any PARENTS magazines either.
b,Oh <laughter>.
%,So. -
qw,"What, uh, what kind of, -"
sd,"Well, I just finished, just, I just finished one last night. A great book."
sd,"It, it's very, a typical for my reading though but a great book, one called, THE THINGS THEY CARRIED by Tim O'Brien."
b,Huh.
%,"And it's, uh, -"
ba,God
sd,I don't know if I would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if I'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories.
b,Oh.
sd,Strange book. Beautifully written.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,Just beautifully written.
qy,"By, uh, somebody who was there"
%,"or, -"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"a guy who was there as a, uh, foot soldier."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So, he considered himself to be, you know, a, a true Vietnam soldier."
b,Yeah.
%,"Well, any of the guys that were ground (( )) -"
%,yes.
%,"Yeah,"
ba,I can imagine.
b,Yeah.
qw,"So, what's the latest one you've read?"
^h,"Well, I tell you what,"
^h,"I'm a kind of, uh, a history nut."
^h,"I'm trying to think back now,"
sd,"I read an awful lot of, uh, periodicals and, uh, you know, almost what you call reference books."

b,"Yeah,"
sv,"well, it was a political move."
b,"Oh, yeah."
sv,"It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the United States."

b,Yeah.

b,Yeah.
sd,"And I just, I got about like a hundred pages through it and realized I had like a thousand more,"

sv,"Uh, national health insurance, I think, is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive."
b,Right.
b,"Yeah,"

b,Right.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I'm, <throat_clearing> I'm sort of mixed on this."
sv,"I think that the, the answer <throat_clearing> may lie in, uh, not in so much a, uh, national kind of medical thing that li-, like England has but more of a, um, <throat_clearing> national insurance, uh, sort of clearinghouse or whatever."
sv,"I think that, uh, too many, uh, -"
sv,"the problem with, with right now is w-, that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through"
sd,"and, and I think that, I think you, you mentioned Canada."

sd,"I mean, you, you go to whoever you want but file through one, one s-, particular,"
b,"Um, I see."

b,Yeah.

b,Uh-huh.

aa,Right.
sd,"Uh, <throat_clearing> I, I was listening, uh, on the radio the other day"
sd,"and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this, -"
sd,"I think they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that could be saved, um, <throat_clearing> in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could, -"
sv,"they could make it, i-, i-, provide health insurance to, to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save."
aa,Yeah.
sd,"<lipsmack> Uh, we're currently, where I'm working now, under Blue Cross."
x,<<Very faint>> <throat_clearing>.
sd,I don't know what the total cost of the program is
sd,"but for dependent coverage I'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that."
b,Right.
sd,"So I assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably,"
x,<Throat_clearing>.

sd,They're probably picking up about half of it.
b,Right.

aa,"Yeah,"

b,<<Very faint>> Yeah.

sd,I forget how much I paid a month
sd,"but it was much, you know, is at least twice if not more expensive than <throat_clearing> the regular health care."
b,<<Very faint>> Yeah.
sd,"And, uh, the reason I, I quite was because of, uh, not because I didn't like it,"
sd,"I, I really kind of did."
sd,"Uh, the reason I quite was just because the, the doctor a, a certain doctor that we en-, enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that H M O"
sd,"so we, my wife decided she wanted to, to stay with that doctor,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"so, <throat_clearing> we went to the, to the, the medical insurance that we have at, here at work,"
b,Yeah.
%,"and, uh, <breathing> I, uh, I like the, I like the convenience of the H M O in, in a certain respect because it, uh, even though you're, -"

sv,"You know, a lot of people complain saying well, I don't want to, uh, have to be told who I need to go to"
sv,"but, you know, <noise> if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,that's right.

sd,"And, um, <throat_clearing> like you say it's, uh, five dollars an office visit."

b,Right.

sv,"But I meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here."
sv,"We're not going to have a jury, you know,"
sv,let's get it over with.
sv,"Sort of like car accidents, # you know, # -"
aa,# Right. #
sv,Well I think that's all ready possible.
b,Yeah.
sv,"I think,"
+,"that you can waive the right to a,"
+,"jury trial # uh,"
%,yeah # --
aa,right <child_talking>. #
aa,-- so. I agree that that should be encouraged.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial.
sv,"But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, you know, tweak a jury into # <laughter> # --"
aa,# Right.
^2,Giving a different sentence. #
+,"-- per-, giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, # the award. #"
sv,# The take. #
aa,Right.
aa,Yeah.
%,"And I suspect it, in cases like, -"
sd,"I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil."
qy,Is that right?
no,"Well, I, I, i-, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme."
b,Yeah.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Well, uh, in the case of,"
+,"civil, uh, things, I think maybe the, the use of the jury is very,"
+,often to the lawyer's advantage
sv,"and I think that may be where jury use is overdone,"
sv,"I mean there are cases where they could be settled,"
+,# maybe # --
+,-- out of court a little more # efficiently. #
aa,# Right. #
%,"But the lawyers are really, uh, -"
sv,"it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience <laughter>,"
+,as possible --
sd,"-- so. Uh, I was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that."
sv,But I am in favor of it for criminal cases #
sd,so there's a difference of my view there for those two. #
aa,# Right.
aa,Right.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"bu-, well you can tell I # haven't been in too many juries <laughter>, judges chambers or anything like that <laughter>."
qy,<Laughter> Have you ever had to serve jury duty?
nn,"N-, -"
no,well I was called once when I was nineteen --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, uh, but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me"
sd,"and, I was doing school and things like -"
sd,"they, they let me out."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"An-, I've never had to it since"
sd,and that was almost twenty years ago # <laughter>. #
b,# Uh-huh. #
%,"It isn't, -"
sd,"sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time,"
+,"in, uh, -"
sd,"that would have been about, uh, twenty years too -- -"
sd,"-- uh, uh, just last year -"
sd,"and, uh, the case I heard was a criminal case"
sd,"and it seemed it really,"
+,trivial.
sd,It involved two bicycles.
sd,We didn't do the sentencing.
sd,The judge did.
b,Huh.
%,So -- -
ba,How interesting.
sd,"-- we, we a-, rendered a verdict"
sd,and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing.
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,Uh-huh <breathing>.
sd,<Swallowing> <lipsmack> And that was here in Wisconsin.
sd,"So I, I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it, -"

b,Oh are you.
qy,Do you work at T I?
ny,"Yeah,"
qy,you?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I just got a little booklet, uh, this not what we're supposed to talk about, just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts,"
sd,"and I thought, I better make some calls."
aa,"I know,"
aa,"I know,"
%,(( )) they.
b,<Laughter> Yeah.
sd,"Well, I haven't had a chance, I haven't got a chance to look at them yet."
sd,It was a lot nicer than I expected.
sd,"My daughter, uh, got a few calls at home."
sd,"She talked to some student in, -"
sd,"I guess they give them to computer students, too, in, uh, Virginia, something like that."
sd,She's talked to two students.
sd,"I've talked to, -"
sd,"I don't think they were students,"
sd,"one, I think, worked at a university, university --"
b,Yeah.

b,"Oh, yeah,"
ba,great.

aa,"Yes,"
aa,we are.
qy,"Do you have anybody that you, uh, are close to that decision on, or anything,"
sd,"or, I've thought about it for myself and all,"
sd,"and my wi-, my wife's mother is in a retirement home."
sd,She's not in a nursing home. Uh.
%,"Oh, well that's a, -"
qy,did you push the button?
ny,"Yeah,"
qy,"did I, didn't we push?"
qy^d,"Did we,"
sd,"Let me, <beep> I'll hit it again just in case."
b,"Okay,"
sd,just in case <laughter>.
sd,"I did it as she said,"

sd,"But, uh, she's --"
%,"Now, what, -"
+,-- she's down in San Antonio --
b,Oh.
sd,"-- and it's, it's a, uh, it's a brand new one."
sd,"It's a Catholic, uh, retirement home for nuns."
sd,"It's at, uh --"
b,Oh.
+,"-- Trinity, uh,"
ar,"no,"
^h,"let me see, Trinity,"
sd,"I keep calling it Trini-, -"
ar,"it's not Trinity,"
%,"I'll think of, -"
sd,"Incarnate Word,"
sd,and they have a retirement home for the nuns --
ba,"Well, isn't that neat."
sd,-- and they take some lay people.
ba,Isn't that neat.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,and that one's really super.
sd,"Now I, I know what they're talking about on regular retirement."
%,"Yeah,"
%,"there's not too many, -"
sd,"they do have a wing where the people who are really sick, you know --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- have nurses.
ba,"Oh, that's good."
sd,"And then they have other wings that we visited, uh, that are very nice."
sd,I mean it's just super.
ba,That's neat.
qy^d,"Just supervised more or less than anything and security, I guess."
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
sd,"they, they, they have, uh, like, uh, a guard with locks."
sd,We've been there once at night at Christmas.
sd,She just went in last year.
bk,Oh.
sd,"She drives and everything,"
sd,"she, she, she's perfectly healthy."
b,Uh-huh.
b,"Uh,"
qw,"What made you all decide to put her, or what made her decide to go?"
sd,"Well, her husband died."
sd,"They were in the military together,"
sd,and she just did not want to take care of the house --
b,Right
x,"(( )) ,"
sd,"-- and she visited the place, and then fell in love with it, and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"so to speak,"
sd,and so --
ba,"Well, that's good."
+,"-- she's happy as, as heck,"
sd,"and they (( )) serve meals, of course."
ba,That's great.
sd,"They have clubs and a swimming pool,"
ba,so that's nice.
sd,"Now I, I know the ones where you're really ill, we visited a long time ago when --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- she had a grandmother that was in one.
sd,And they were all more or less hospitalized type --
b,Right.
+,"-- you know, really, really sick."
%,"Shut-ins and, -"
sv,It's a tough question.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,it really is.
sd,I worked in one as a teenager.
sd,"I volunteered,"
sd,"Oh, you got (( )) more experience than I do then on it."
sd,"Well, it was really, it was really sad, heartbreaking, I guess."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,yeah.
sd,"And, uh, I just, oh, I just felt for those people, especially the ones that never got visited."
sv,"# Oh, that would be awful. #"
sd,# That just bothered me. #
sd,"I never thought about that, you know."
sd,"That just bothered me so much, especially, you know, at my age,"
sd,I was probably about fourteen.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And that really made a bad impression on me <laughter>.
sd,"I always thought, not really bad of them, I mean, because they are, most of them I believe are probably pretty good for the people,"
h,"but, I don't know."
sv,"It's just a, it would be a tough, tough decision."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"I think that, uh, hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it,"
sv,and they're getting nicer.
b,Right.
sd,"I've seen on T V where they take animals and young children,"
sd,in fact my daughter is one.
sd,"My wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school, took them to an elderly home,"
sv,and boy that really pumps them up.
aa,"Helps,"
aa,yeah.
sv,That is very nice to see young people.
sv,"I think that's one of the sad things, is when you're in an older home."
aa,"Uh-huh,"
aa,uh-huh.
sv,"If you just have people your own age, you never get a chance to see kids or anything --"
b,Right.
+,"-- or animals or anything, you know --"
b,Right.
sv,"-- you can't take care of them,"
sv,kind of obvious you can't take care of children or animals --
b,Right.
+,"-- in a nursing home,"
sv,but it's nice to have them visit and everything.
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,and get that youth back.
b,Yeah.
sv,"You know, sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people to, because some of them are so, um, just stationary --"
b,Right.
sv,"-- I mean, they'll get in a wheelchair"
sv,or they'll just sit in a chair
sv,"and, and, until you come along and really try and pump them up, they're just stationary,"
sd,"and I feel like, gosh, that's all they do all day long."
sd,"So I do, love to see young kids go and, and men take the pets and everything."
sv,"I think that's a real, real neat idea."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"I think you do get more by stimul-, by stimulation."
sd,"My, in fact, my mother in law just visited."
sd,"She's just about seventy-five. Again, perfectly fine."
b,Yeah.
sd,"But, one, and, and she visited us here in, in Dallas."
sd,"When she went back, every time she goes back to, uh, San Antonio, my wife has two sisters there, too, she said she's much better,"
sd,"she's much more alive and, and, uh, active when she's been on a visit --"
%,"That's, -"
+,"-- with somebody else, you know --"
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- and, and our routine has (( )) obviously hectic with teenagers and everything --"
b,Right.
%,"-- and she's much, -"
sv,"and so the stimulation part is really important. I think, like any animal, anything --"
b,Right.
sv,"-- you just lay around, uh, that's the fastest way to die, I think, you know."
aa,Stagnant <laughter>.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,that's exactly right.
sv,I think they're really neat.
sd,"Um, of course I've seen those reports on T V, the horrible ones --"
b,"Oh, yeah."
sd,-- and that scares me.
sd,I'm afraid I'm a T V flipper.
sd,"Anything bad, I like, I like to,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"flip, <laughter> I flip it off."
sv,"But it's sad,"
sv,"it's sad,"
%,yeah.
sv,"It's sad to think that we would do that to people,"
sd,"and you know, I've seen them on T V with, uh, bed sores,"
sd,and --
b,"Oh, yeah."
+,"-- oh, they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry."
sd,"And I just think, how can you do that?"
sv,"These people have given so much of their lives, you know, to, to America --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, whatever,"
sv,and here is how we treat them.
sv,Just put them in a home and leave them.
aa,Right.
sd,"When I was, uh, younger, we, I lived in the East,"
sd,"I'm from the East really,"
sd,"and it seemed like there were several people that I knew that had their, uh, parents, I guess they would be, but well in their seve-, -"
sd,living with them.
b,Uh-huh <noise> <<water sound>>.
sd,"And one of them was even a woman who was fairly old,"
sd,"and I guess she, <noise> <<water sound>> she had her own separate room."
sd,"And I think, whether it's more a custom up there, or maybe because I was younger -- -"
b,Right.
sv,"-- and it's just not a custom anymore to have, uh, you know, the grandparents live with you anymore."
sv,"I guess that, uh --"
%,"I think, -"
+,"-- well, we aren't getting away from that, which is not right."
aa,Right.
sv,I think it's neat.
sv,"I think, uh, you learn a lot from them --"
b,"Oh, yeah."
+,"-- from all their experiences,"
sd,"and, and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories."
b,"Oh, right,"
b,right.
sv,"I think that's neat,"
sv,"because they really have a lot of good i-, insights --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- that my fa-, my husband's father is really old."
sd,"He, he had him late in life,"
sd,"and he's, he'll be eighty this year."
b,Oh.
sd,"And I just, uh, he lives with different, you know, people in the family."
sd,He'll switch from time to time.
%,"I just, -"
ba,"Well, that's nice in a lot of ways."
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"I just couldn't imagine locking, -"
sd,"not locking him up, but putting him in a home and just, -"
qy^d,Bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake.
%,"Yeah,"
%,"right,"
sd,Lock him up.
sd,"That's what I think about it for me,"
sd,"I think, Well, my kids better not do that to me."
aa,"I know,"
aa,I know.
sd,"I don't want that, you know."
sd,"So I, I think of it, Well, how would I want to be treated --"
aa,"Right,"
aa,exactly.
+,"-- rather than, well, -"
sv,"it's easy to say, Oh, yeah,"
^q,"let's put these old folks in a home,"
sd,"but when I think I don't want to do that, you know. -"
sd,I don't want to be -- -
aa,That's right.
sd,-- I'd want to have my little home.
sd,"I always threaten my daughters,"
sd,"I say, Well, I'm going to build a little house behind yours,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"and I'll take care of your lawn, he says,"
^q,but I'm not <laughter> going to one of those places.
^q,"Oh, you're going to put me away."
aa,"Right,"
aa,yeah.
sd,"That's what my mother, -"
%,"she always, -"
^q,"You're going to lock me up one day, aren't you."
x,<Laughter>.
^q,"I can tell,"
^q,you're going to lock me up.
sv,"That's what we, that's the way we call it, which is really wrong."
aa,I know.
sd,"But my wife's mother, and the one, she's in San Ant-, -"
sd,it's everything but.
sd,The opposite of what you've seen.
sd,I mean --
b,Right.
+,"-- it's a little hotel, you might say."
ba,That's great.
sd,"Again, a swimming pool, and grounds,"
sd,and she has enough room.
sd,"She has two bedrooms, and a, and a --"
ba,Gosh.
+,-- separate living area.
sd,They don't have kitchens or anything --
b,Right.
sd,"-- but they have little, it's like uh, on each floor they have a little kitchen area --"
b,Yes.
+,-- where you can go down and have a --
^2,"Prepare your, -"
+,"-- make a meal, you know."
ba,"Well, that's great."
qy,"Now can she leave, um, on a day by herself?"
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
sd,"it's, it's, it's nothing like that."
sd,It's like living in the hotel.
sd,I mean --
ba,"Oh, man."
+,-- she's totally on her own.
ba,That's neat.
sd,"Uh, and she still drives, which we do, does scare us some, because she has dented a few things, you know,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"and we keep thinking about that, you know --"
b,Right.
sv,"-- because she, they get less alert,"
sv,"and they don't care,"
sd,"and I've seen some of these elderly people on T V you know, the ones from Florida that just run into people"
sd,and they don't even --
b,Right.
+,"-- understand what happened, you know."
aa,"I know,"
ba,"bless their hearts,"
sv,"you hate to hurt them by doing that,"
sv,that's --
aa,I know.
+,"-- like their one last thing that they can still do,"
sv,and you take away that driving ability
sv,and that would really be hard.
sd,"We've,"
aa,"I, I know."
ad,"Go ahead,"
fa,I'm sorry.
+,"Well, we've thought about doing that for my husband's father, because he, -"
qy,"Oh, he still drives?"
ny,Yeah.
ba,"That's gre-, well, it's wonderful in one respect,"
qy^d,"but I don't know if you can afford the insurance,"
%,yeah.
arp_nd,"Well, luckily he drives a big old tank <laughter>."
b,Yeah.
sv,"So, he, I mean, I don't think he, he could get hurt."
sd,I just hope to God he doesn't ever hurt anyone.
sd,But he --
b,Right.
+,-- he hasn't had any accidents luckily.
ba,That's good.
sv,"I mean, people are all different."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,yeah.
sv,"I, I wonder if they should give them a test, or at least maybe not take their licen-, maybe give them a refresher driving course, and just to see how well they are every five years."
sd,I saw that on TWENTY TWENTY.
qy,Are they doing it?
no,"They, um, you know, they're testing that, they're, you know, thinking of doing that."
sv,"And I think that would be a great idea, because I think they do, come, become less aware,"
sv,"and they just, I don't know, they, and they don't hear as well, for one thing --"
b,Yeah.
sv,-- and that doesn't help.
sv,"Well, everybody needs retraining."
sv,"It doesn't hurt, uh,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"you know,"
sv,"the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches,"
sv,and I don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving.
b,Right.
sv,"It would sure, the insurance companies would, would probably help pay for some of that, you know."
sv,At least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away <laughter>.
aa,"Right,"
ba,"there you go,"
ba,there's a good point --
sv,It's on the state <laughter>.
ba,-- very good point.
ba,Very good point.
sv,"But I think they maybe, should do that,"
%,"and then the families, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",All (( righty )) .
sd,"Uh, I'll just hand it off to you"
sd,and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today.
sd,"Well, uh, the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts"
sd,"and, uh, I've been involved in making, uh, hat stands and, uh, rag dolls and, uh, different type hats with, uh, flowers and roses, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing, straw hats and,"
b,Oh <<Sounds like typing noises in background>>.
+,all that kind of stuff.
sd,"And I enjoy it,"
sv,it's relaxing.
sv,And you kind of get absorbed in it
sv,"so the time goes by, you know, before you realize anything is going on."
sd,"And I play the organ sometimes, uh, just for my own satisfaction <laughter>. Not for anybody else's ears"
sd,"because I'm not that good at it,"
sd,but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while.
bh,Oh really?
qo,How about yourself?

sv,"first one, you know how that is."
sd,"And, um, <throat_clearing> uh, I play the guitar and a banjo."
sd,"I mainly play the guitar a lot,"
sd,I play about every night.
sd,"And, um, I really love that,"
sv,"if I had a (( druther )) , -"
sv,"if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something,"

sd,"I like bluegrass, too."
b,"yeah,"

sv,"Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,"

aa,"Yeah,"
aa,exactly.
sd,"I like things that, you know, two people can do,"
sd,"but I like the quiet of doing things away, you know,"
sv,"kind of gives you some space for yourself,"

sd,"in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses"
sd,"and, uh, that was kind of for them,"
sd,"but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know,"

qy,"We're to talk about what, lawns and gardens?"
sd,Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do.
sd,"I'm, I'm a putterer."
sd,I chose that topic because I really like gardening --
b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.
%,"I, well, -"
sd,"it's, it's, it's very <laughter> str-, strange that I got this call because my wife just called me."
sd,I was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn --
b,<Laughter> Oh.
+,"-- and, you know, mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden,"
sd,"this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall, fall bulbs."
b,Uh-huh.
%,Uh.
sd,We've had a late fall
sd,"it seems like, the weather, -"
sd,"in fact today it's really warm,"
sd,"and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up,"
sv,but you know you need to pretty soon.
sd,"Well, that's the way this was."
sd,"The, the petunias were really great."
sd,"Our mums are, are beautiful,"
b,Oh.
sd,"Uh, I don't know if we, I don't think we've had a frost up here."
sd,"I've been, I was down in (( )) for a week,"
sd,so I don't know what happened last week --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- uh, but, uh, it seems like it's, I don't know if it's late."
sd,I'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer
sd,so I can get a lot of stuff down out here.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, I, I enjoy it."
sd,"We came here, we just moved into this, well, we moved in in November and put all, all the landscaping in this, this year."
sd,"We came from nine years in a condo, uh,"
sd,"and working in that condo, you didn't have to do anything --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know, unless you really wanted to,"

bf,So now --

+,"-- you have the chance to really create and, and spread out."
aa,Right.
%,"You know, I can't, -"
sd,"this is my third, third house I think, I've owned, um,"
sd,"but, uh, it's interesting, you know,"
sd,"the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling,"
sd,and it sort of gets away from me --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- if you're not with it.
sd,"So, but, uh, I, I enjoy most of it,"
sd,"and about this time of year there is, it starts getting a little old,"
sd,"and I start looking forward to, you know, having other things to do with my --"
bf,The grass --
+,-- (( )) .
+,-- not growing so fast <laughter>.
ar,"Well, it is, it is for me"
sd,because I've been doing a lot of fertilizing.
sd,"We had a terrible summer,"
sd,we had a drought --
b,Oh.
sd,"-- and, uh, took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,"
sd,and now it's really growing
sd,"and I'm trying to establish a good root, root growth --"
%,Um --
+,"-- you know, for the winter."
sd,-- ours seems to have slowed down here.
sd,We're not having to mow every week religiously --
b,Really.
sd,"-- but we're still fighting bugs, and ready to change some of the, the summer flowers out --"
%,Uh.
sd,"-- I still have caladiums that are pretty, which is a surprise this late in the year."
bh,"Oh, really?"
ny,Uh-huh.
%,Um.
sd,"But like today, it's eighty-five degrees --"
b,"Oh, yeah --"
sd,"-- it's really strange,"
b,"-- yeah,"
sd,"I hear that from, my brother-in-law lives in Plano,"
sd,But that'll change --
b,Yeah <laughter>.
+,-- real quick <laughter>.
sd,"Well, he always -- -"
sd,We'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already.
sd,-- <Laughter> he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here
sd,"and then he calls us,"
ba,"Oh, my gosh."
b,yeah
sd,it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine.
%,So <laughter>. -
sd,"Well, Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants, because our summers are so terribly hot --"
%,(( )) .
sd,-- and we have ice storms every year.
sd,And there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- extremes.
sd,Some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"that is, -"
sd,"I was, you know, I was like conditioned to it --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- they, they have to be hardened to it"
sd,"that's, that's strange with me."
sd,"You know, you think, Dallas, you know, almost semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of problem,"
%,"but, -"
sd,"Well, for the most part we don't,"
sd,but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold.
sd,"Well, the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- but the, the ice storms really are stressful on all the, the plants that we have around."
sd,We've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to --
b,"Really,"
bh,oh do they.
+,"-- and, uh, pittosporum"
sd,that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- you, you --"
sd,"I love, -"
+,"-- really take a chance with them freezing,"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I love the, uh, the landscaping,"
sd,"like I say, my brother-in-law (( )) . I get to Carrollton quite a bit."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I go there on business,"
sd,"and I really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens,"
sd,"and Texas is, -"
sd,"D-, Dallas is very nice."
sd,"I really enjoy it there. The landscaping, the homes, the architecture, the whole thing --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- very enjoyable gardens,"
sd,"and my wife and I, -"
sd,"Except for the lack of trees, out where we are # <laughter>. #"
%,# Well. # -
+,"It was all cotton fields,"
sd,"and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful, we really miss it."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"that we have, you know -- -"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- Ohio's a very pretty state.
sd,"We moved, in seventy-six we moved to Chicago,"
sd,"we lived there for five years,"
sd,"and I remember the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt,"
sd,"uh, we were coming in"
sd,and before the plane landed she looked out the window
sd,"and she said, she said, (( )) there's no trees down there."
x,<Laughter>.
^q,"(( )) this is Illinois,"
^q,you're not. -
sd,"And, when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house, there were no trees --"
%,Um.
+,-- because the farmers had cleared all the land --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and now all of a sudden it was being developed,"
sd,"and the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
qy,Do you have any children?
ny,"Uh, yes,"
sd,I have a daughter.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I don't any children <laughter>,"
sv,so I'm going to have difficulty with this topic.
bk,"Oh, okay."
qo,"But, uh, what kinds of things do you and your family do?"
sd,"Um, well, we go out and fly kites"
sd,and we go fishing.
sd,And we go to movies
sd,and we go out to the farm.
sd,"And, and, uh, she likes to pick flowers and look at birds."
sv,Um. Then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days.
sv,I don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that.
ba,That's great.
sd,"Well, I'm divorced,"
sd,"but that's what, <laughter> when she's with me that's what we do."
b,Yeah.
sd,And we color a lot
sd,and I read her stories.
b,Uh-huh.
ba,That's great.
b,Yeah.
sv,"I think a lot of families now, they probably don't spend enough time together."
b,Yeah.
sv,"You know, whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together"
sv,"and, and I think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed."
sv,Just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing
sv,"and, uh, because that I think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot."
sv,"And the communication helps you build on your, uh, helps just, just build your family."
b,Uh-huh
sd,"<<pause>>. And even, even when I was, when I was, uh, living with her with did stuff then too,"
b,Uh-huh.
b,Yeah.
ba,"That's pretty, to me that's pretty rare."
+,"Yeah,"
sd,I know.
sd,I like that.
sd,"Whenever I do have children I, I'm going to try as hard as I can to s-, see that we spend a lot of time together, you know,"
sd,"maybe just even, if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the time."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"You know, that's good sometimes because you need to, you know, get away."
sv,"But, um, I don't think you, you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of, of losing your fam-, the family unit."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,that's right.
sv,Because then you never get to know them either.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,They're all grown up
%,"and their, -"
b,Yeah.
b,Yeah.
%,"And as I understand it, -"
h,"I don't know,"
sd,"I haven't experienced it,"
b,Yeah.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve, you know, you've pretty much lost them <laughter>."
aa,"Yeah,"
bf,they're out doing stuff by that time.
aa,Yeah.
qy,"So, um, do you think that you, do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I really do because, because I don't see many others (( ))"
sd,"and when, whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays, we'll see other families."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, not usually on the weekends <noise> we don't see very many in comparison."
qo,"What do you think is the key to, to just bringing the American family back together?"
qo,What kinds of things do you think can?
sv,"Well, I think they can turn off the T V for one thing."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,that's true.
+,"And, and go out and do stuff, you know."
sd,Because she always likes to do things whenever the T V -s off.
sd,"You know, she'll forget about the T V completely."
+,Huh. I think that's the first thing a lot of people do
sd,and I know I'm guilty of it.
sd,Like I came in from work today
sd,first thing I did was turn the TV on.
b,Uh-huh.
+,Because I taped the stories from <laughter> earlier today.
b,Right.
sd,And I like to watch 'em
sv,"but, I think that's that is a big problem. The television"
sv,"and it's, it's too static, you know,"
sv,it's something that you can do
sv,"but there's no thinking involved, no motion, you know,"
sv,"and I think, think that's another reason why people are, uh, so health conscious now is because America's becoming really a couch potato society."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"You know, people aren't doing anything just sitting around, you know, no thinking involved"
sv,"and now, I think I think people are trying to get out of that."
%,At least -
%,"and that, um, there's a lot of <breathing> um, -"
sv,it's becoming really health conscious
sv,and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that.
sv,"And that's probably good, you know,"
sv,"if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that, that also helps."
sv,"That's also something, you know, family oriented that everyone can do."
b,Yeah.
%,Um.
b,Yeah.
sd,"But when was, uh, when she was here last summer we played tennis"
sd,but she hasn't brought her tennis racquet over lately.
b,Uh-huh.
%,"When, -"
qw,"How, how old is she?"
sd,she's five.
%,"Um. Well, she has, -"
sd,"We, we just been hitting the ball on the ground."
bk,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
sd,"She can't hit it in the air yet,"
sd,and then we kick the ball.
sd,We play like soccer.
sv,You've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years <laughter>.
ny,Uh-huh.
ba,That's good.

qw,Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy? <<TV and background noise>>.
sd,"Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that the other day,"
sd,"and, uh, I really don't know the answer, <laughter>,"
sd,"uh, I would sort of like to, uh, think about something in the way of, uh, uh, sort of a sporty car but not any, not, you know, a luxury type sporty one."
b,Yeah.
sd,"But, um, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things."
qy^d,"Oh, you do want a lot of that stuff?"
ny,"Yeah,"
ny,"well, yeah"
sd,"I like, I like some of those things."

t1,"well, what do you call them,"
sd,"you said amenities,"
b^m,Amenities.
+,"that they have,"
qw,"but what about, um, their reputation of the company or the price."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"well, of course, I guess, uh, price is always the big consideration,"
%,"but, -"
sd,"It is for me,"
sv,"other people,"
b,yeah.
+,don't seem to have the same problem <laughter>.
sd,"<Laughter> Well, that's, that's a big one in my book,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"but, uh, um, I have preferences for, uh, for some, uh, makers over others, um,"
sd,"and I would sort of like to buy American,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"but, you know, I'm not so totally hung up on that, that <<clicking sounds>> I wouldn't buy something else,"
qo,how about you?
sd,"Well, um, the last car (( we )) bought was American because of, because of that reason,"
sd,"but (( have )) not been entirely happy with, uh, several things about the car, -"
sd,it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be.
bh,"Oh, really?"
sd,"Because several things, minor things sort of, -"
sd,"but still they cost us money, um, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that, that was that new,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"you know,"
sd,we bought the car new
%,"and after, -"
sd,"um, well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch."
b,Oh.
sd,"And, they just said, well, you know, clutches are (( disposable )) ,"
sd,"and I said, since when?"
b,Yeah.
sd,"Brake pads are (( disposable )) ,"
b,Yeah.
+,"you know,"
sd,"we know that,"
sd,but I never thought a clutch was disposable.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,I wouldn't have thought so either.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"so that was, that was kind of a shock <laughter>."
b,Oh.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"I, I guess there's a lot to, to think about when you're trying to make that decision."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"you know, the less actually, the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars, -"
sd,"they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like, like, uh, uh, a Mercedes Benz,"
sd,"they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable."
b,Right.
sv,"You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes,"
aa,No
%,"but then, -"
+,especially not after two years.
aa,"No,"
sd,"but on the other hand, I guess, too, uh, whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune."
bh,Really?
h,Oh I don't know.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I've, uh, worked with a couple of people who have owned, uh, various years, uh,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,Mercedes
sd,"and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just buying the parts and everything is, is pretty expensive."
sd,"But for them it's, it's sort of a hobby, too,"
b,Yeah.
+,to own them (( )) .
qw,"What kind of, -"
qw,what brand of car are you thinking about buying
qw,or (( like )) what things are you looking at?

sd,"I've been kind of, um, -"
sd,"I guess the commercials are getting to me, the Toyota commercials,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"and I know that a lot of people I've, I've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, that hardly had any problems at all."
b,"Yeah,"

aa,Uh-huh.
sd,"My, uh, daughter has owned two different ones,"
sd,"and, uh, you know, we've had some work done on them"
sd,"but it's not too bad,"
%,"and the reason, -"
sd,"one of the reasons we, um, bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years"
sd,and he lived way out in the country
sd,"so he put a lot of miles on it,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot,"

%,"yeah,"
sv,"this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female <laughter>."
sd,<Laughter> I was afraid we might get into an argument.
aa,Right.
sv,"Well, uh, I guess uh, there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations,"
b,Uh-huh.

sv,"and uh, I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now,"
b,Right.
+,"And trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,"
sv,"they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"it, it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore, the women are spreading themselves thinner,"
aa,"Oh, I think so."

qy,Do you work outside the home?
ny,Yes.
qy,Do you have children?

ba,Oh sure.
sd,"they still take time,"

b,Right.
%,"So, uh, yeah"

b,Yeah.
sd,"on the other hand, I can't imagine just being at home, uh, although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, still, uh, there's, there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having, you know, a job and all that goes with that."
aa,"No,"

sd,"In fact, I, I work out of my home."

b,Oh.

sd,it's a way for me to stay home.
b,Uh-huh.

sv,I know it's going to be a slow change.
sv,"Uh, I, I feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner."
sd,I mean I'm just thinking of my circle of people that I know.

b,Yeah.

ny,"yeah,"
sd,"I, well I see, I think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the, the family things work."
b,Right.
sv,"Uh, but I don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers, you know."
sv,"It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are,"
sv,I don't know if they want to completely give that up.
aa,"Right,"
sv,it's a very personal thing.
sv,"But, it would be nice if there could be an in-between, a middle ground somewhere."
b,Yeah.
sd,"I think it's hard though when you talk about, about families and, and raising children"
sv,"because ch-, I think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground."
sv,"I think they, uh, they need security"
%,"and yet they, -"
h,"I don't know,"

sd,"from speaking from my children, the-, they aren't real flexible <laughter> when it comes to things like that."
b,Yeah.

sd,"I, I'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society."
aa,"Well, yes,"
sd,"I, I like the fact that, you know, gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions,"

qw,Where do you get most of your news?
sd,"I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour,"
sd,and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends.
qw,"Where, where are you?"
sd,I'm in Dallas.
bk,"Oh, yeah."
qy,Are you in Dallas also?
nn,"No,"
sd,I'm in San Antonio.
b,"Oh, really,"
bk,okay.
sd,I get my news from a combination of sources.
sd,I take the paper every day --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and I read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool."
bh,"Oh, really."
ny,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, and I watch the, uh, actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work."
sd,"And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- from the news.
sd,"I normally find that uh, I-, I'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,"
sd,"so I don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch."
sd,"I, I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because I used to get it during the week --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- but, um, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,reading it in the morning.
b,Yeah.
sd,"So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work."
sd,"Um, the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and I enjoy that quite a bit.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Um, one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
sd,"I will admit I work with, uh, someone who's Iranian,"
sd,and he definitely has a very different slant on the news.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"He's very, very skeptical of the news media,"
sd,and I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also.
sd,"But he's, I don't know, uh, he's mu-, much, much more so."
sd,"It's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, um, different perspective with all the Gulf goings on, um."
sd,"He was always speaking in terms of, you know, American imperialism reasserting itself."
sv,"Um, I suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country."
b,Uh-huh <<pause>>.
sd,"Well I, I, uh, I like the print news --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize.
aa,"True, um,"
%,"the, -"
sv,I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't.
sd,"They, um, <barking> tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.
sd,"Sort of like the, uh, what is that, A B C's NIGHTLINE."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Well, I guess they only normally stick with just the one, um, story."
sv,"But they, they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories."
bf,"They don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in, in every little town."
aa,"No,"
aa,no.
sd,It's very much national interest news.
b,Yeah.
sd,"A lot of times they end up, um, with these panels of experts"
sd,"and they go back and forth, where everyone's giving some opinions"
%,"and sometimes that, -"
sd,"I don't know the value of that, because I saw plenty of jokes and, and, um, oh, editorial cartoons about all the retired generals,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"making a living <laughter> during the, the Gulf War."
sd,I've been getting a kick out of those lately.
b,Uh-huh.
%,"Although, um <<pause>>. -"
sd,"I-, I'm only twenty-five,"
sd,so I've never actually been through a period of war --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and I don't know anyone in the military
sd,"and I don't have a lot of background knowledge in, uh, military strategy and, and weaponry, and, and all that kind of stuff."
sv,And I thought the generals were very interesting.
sd,"Now when they started to speculate, I, I saw that for what is was,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on.
sv,"But I thought the-, the-, they were interesting,"
sd,"and, and they shed some light on what was going on for me."
aa,I will admit it's interesting.
sd,"I-, I-, I'm twenty-six."
sd,So I don't have any more experience in that than you.
sv,"Um, it, it, it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind, you know,"
sd,"there were some that were screaming for air power,"
sd,there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world, which I suppose just about everyone does,"
sd,"but these guys had a, a, uh, national soap box to stand on and, and express this view."
sd,"You know, one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C,"
sd,and it was for children --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and it was hosted by Peter Jennings,"
sv,"and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio,"
sd,and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions.
sd,"And they, they had all their correspondents in the different areas, in Saudi Arabia, and Israel, and, and all."
sd,"They had them all, uh, on,"
sd,I don't know what you'd call it other than on line.
sd,They had them all on hold --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer, they would cut to that person,"
sd,and that person would answer the question.
sv,"It was just very informative and interesting,"
sd,"and, uh, I was real impressed at how A B C handled, uh, translating,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,the war for children.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I didn't see anything like that, although I did, uh, -"
sd,"I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting, -"
h,"this is getting a little off the topic,"
sd,"but there was a, a, a big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- to, to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children."
sv,I thought that was a really unusual thing.
sd,"And our local H E B stores here, -"
sd,"I don't know if it's H E B statewide or whatever,"
sd,"but they have videos that, uh, -"
sd,"I don't know if they still have them,"
sd,"but they were free rental,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"videos, that had something to do with the war."
%,"<<Pause>> Ju-, -- -"
%,"Uh, it was, -"
qy^d,"-- It-, with the children's aspect?"
na,Right.
sd,"It was something for children, that they, they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and, uh, getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- and that kind of thing.
sv,I suppose that is a valuable service.
sd,"Again not having, uh, lived through another war, I don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of,"
sd,or if that was --
sd,Well --
+,-- a new concern with people.
+,"-- back during the Viet Nam conflict that no one will, will have the guts enough to call a real war --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- uh, the, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal."
aa,That's true.
aa,That's true.
sv,So I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news.
sv,"And <<blank spot in the tape>> probably more importantly, one that lasted short enough that, that people's interest didn't flag too badly."
aa,Yeah.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","I tell you what,"
sd,"the first three days, I was glued to the television."
sd,I will admit the same thing.
sd,"And I,"
%,"And I, -"
+,would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer
sd,"and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program --"
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- and I, I was just, I was horrified and fascinated <laughter> by what I was seeing."
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",I tell you what.
sd,"The uh, the war start-, <<blank spot in tape>> -"
^h,"let's see, was it a Wednesday or Thursday?"
sd,"Must have been Thursday, uh,"
sd,"and Friday night I was, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Because I was watching C N N,"
sd,"and they would, they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus,"
sd,"and the people would be standing there in gas masks,"
sd,"and you'd be hearing the sirens,"
%,"and it was just, -"
sd,I was amazed.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I, I didn't have that experience."
sd,"I, I don't have cable --"
b,Oh.
sv,"-- so I, I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought, I thought they did a very good job."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Um, I've got one question for you."
qy^d,I <<pause>> you say you take the newspaper.
ny,Uh-huh.
sv,"Um, I, I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting."
sv,"We've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription."
b,Uh-huh.
qy,"Does San Antonio ha-, -"
qy,"you said San Antonio, right?"
ny,Uh-huh.
qy,"Do you have just one paper,"
qrr,or do you have several?
nn,No.
sd,"There are two,"
sv,and they're pretty close.
sd,"Uh, the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,"
sd,I grew up near Houston --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck,"
sd,"and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up. I mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"It's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"and I enjoy, -"
sv,the comics are better in this newspaper.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy
sd,and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of.
%,"So, -"
sd,"I, I actually take both newspapers on the weekends."
bh,Do you?
sd,"I figure I'm only taking on the weekend,"
sd,and I can afford that.
b,Yeah.
sd,"I, I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better,"
sd,"but I sort of have a liberal political slant,"
sv,"and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook."
sd,"And my,"
sd,I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit.
+,My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers.
sd,"He takes both San Antonio papers, an Austin paper, both Houston papers,"
sd,"I guess he takes seven, the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper,"
sd,"but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University,"
sd,so he's getting all the sports sections.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, so, you know, he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread ..."
sv,"In, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem."
^g,Do you?
qw,Why?
qw,Why?
sv,"Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away."
qy,You think the problem is not enough doctors?
na,"I think the problem is that the doctor v-, doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your h-, uh, unemp-, I mean, on your liability."
ba,"Gosh,"
bh,Oh?
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- for one thing.
qy,And you think there are plenty of doctors?
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
sd,I don't think there is a shortage of doctors
sd,"and I do know that O B, which is my field --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- the doctors' health in-, the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year --"
ba,It's astronomical.
+,-- that deliver babies.
sv,Now they can't doing anything about that.
sv,I don't think they're in a conspiracy.
sv,"I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them."
ar,"No,"
sv,people don't sue --
sv,"People are very sue, sue conscious."
sv,-- lawyers sue.
sv,If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor --
b,Yeah.
aa,"Well, that's probably true, too."
sv,But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days.
ba,"Well, sure."
%,"And, so, -"
sv,"But, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory."
qy,You know what tort theory is?
nn,No.
sd,"Well, a tort is when you do something wrong."
b,Right.
%,"Well, it, uh, -"
sv,an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.
aa,That's right.
sv,"If the baby is born dead, well, that happens."
%,"Well, -"
sv,"If, if they have complications and, -"
aap_am,It depends.
sd,"Well, I know, I mean, there are guys that are real slobs,"
sd,"but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job."
aa,"Well, that's true,"
sv,they are --
+,-- because doctors are performing many more tests.
x,<Throat_clearing>.
sv,"Many of them are unnecessary,"
sd,they are doing so many C sections --
sv,Just to prevent a --
+,-- just to --
+,-- a law suit.
+,-- prevent. -
sd,Because they have all these monitors now
sv,and if anything looks even a little bit funny --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby,"
sv,and --
b,Yeah.
+,-- so it's costing more all around in health insurance --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay."
sd,"See, I believe --"
sd,"So, it's terrible."
+,"-- that there, there is a system already in place for health care."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"You know, they have indigent health care."
sd,You show up at Parkland bleeding --
^2,You'll get it.
aa,That's true.
sd,"In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too."
b,Yeah.
sd,And we have that happen.
sd,We have patients that go through Parkland --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- through the clinic
sd,"and at the last minute, they come to us."
sd,Well --
b,Uh-huh
x,<<faint>>.
+,"-- uh, we can't turn them away."
%,"So, -"
b,"Yeah,"
sv,I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation --
b,Yeah.
+,-- the problem would pretty much evaporate.
aa,<Laughter> I'm for that.
sd,"I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer,"
sd,so --
b,Yeah.

b,"Yeah,"

sd,They stop their O B at least.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies --"
b,"Right,"
+,-- ever.
b,Right.
sd,His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.
ba,That's incredible.
sd,"And, you know, he said, I had to, he had to ear-, gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice."
b,Yeah.
sv,And most of them are very sincere.

b,Yeah

sd,Occasionally --

aa,"Yes,"
sd,"I, I agree something should be done,"
sv,"but I, there, I don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons, because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct <lipsmack> will have access to weapons from somewhere"

sd,"and in the last few years I've said, no way."
sd,"Matter of fact, if I find a, uh, a, a fly running around in the house, I pick him up and carry him outdoors <laughter>."
sd,"I, I don't even hit him with a flyswatter,"
sd,"so I've, uh, gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and, and killing and that sort of thing."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But I, I think that, uh, personally, that we do need some weapons available to most of the people."
sv,"Most of the people really are, uh, honest and, uh, worthy of carrying on their lives properly."
sd,"Uh, I'm sort of in line thinking in terms, -"
sv,I don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon.
sv,I mean there's nothing wrong with that.
qy,Do you see anything wrong with that?
nn,"No,"
sd,"there's only one problem I have with the whole thing though, th-, is, you know, when they do it, I think our biggest problem is, yes, the, the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available."
b,Right.
sv,I think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available. And the types of the weapons.
sd,I mean there is --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- no, -"
sd,"I'm again-, I'm against this, uh, automatic and # semiautomatic stuff. #"
aa,"# Right,"
sv,"there is, #"
sv,I don't think we should have access to those.
+,"There is no reason for it. I mean,"
aa,No.
b,Huh <<faint>>.
sd,"And, uh, maybe I'm a little bit strong when I said total gun t-, control."
sd,"That's, that's really not what I meant."
sv,"But, I mean we need control."
sv,We've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening
sv,"and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the, in the --"
b,Yes.
+,-- in the public.
sv,"And the, the people should be, uh, selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're, they're not, uh, acquiring weapons for illicit use."
sv,"Uh, that is not good."
sv,There's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms.
sd,"As a matter of fact, uh, there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who, uh, brought to me a target from a rifle that he, uh, pretty well, halfway designed"
sd,"and he, he put together the, uh, the bullets in it --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and he was showing me that at a hundred yards, he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards."
sv,"Now, see from a technical point of view, that is something that, that our military people need to know about."
%,Um.
sv,"So there are other interesting, uh, facets in, in guns and weapons."
sd,"This is a, uh, bolt action rifle, I think he has."
sd,"And he has done other things to the way the, uh, barrel sits in the, uh, <lipsmack> the wood part of it."
sd,"And, uh, he designed the, the, the bullets themselves"
sd,and he has <breathing> fantastic accuracy.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Just, just from a technical point of view, that interests me. Not to kill anybody with it or anything with it, but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate."
aa,<Breathing> Yes.
aa,"All right,"
sv,"you, you sound like you're into the technology of it, which is, -"
aa,"yeah, I agree."
sd,"And, you know, and, again, I'm, my entire family are, they are all hunters --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, you know, they, they don't appreciate my stand,"
sd,and I --
b,Yeah.

sd,I really don't.
sv,"It's just <laughter> when they come out and they say they need an Uzi in order to do some accurate or decent deer hunting, I think <laughter>, I think that's totally outrageous."
sv,"What's happening is people are losing, -"
sv,they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue.
b,Yeah.
sv,"And the issue,"
x,<Throat_clearing>.

fa,sorry about my mind.

qw,When was the last time you went?

sd,We do an awful lot of camping.
qo,How about yourself?
sd,"Well, I haven't been in probably about three years."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And the last time we went was in, um, well, I guess it was, it was like hunting season,"

b,"Yes, oh,"

ba,Very good.
sv,I bet it's pretty over there.

^h,"Um, let's see. -"
qw,"# What do you think, what kind of # --"
qy,# Do you do a lot of fishing? #

qy,"Do you go out,"
qy,"and is camping for you in a motor home, or a trailer,"
qrr,or do you actually put up a tent
%,"or, -"
sd,One of the ones that you pull along --
bk,"Oh, okay,"
bf,"so you have, -"
qy,"-- and then pop-u-, is it pop-up?"
ny,Yeah.
b,Pop-up.
qy,"A pop-up trailer, huh."
ny,Yeah.
qw,What do you have?
sd,We have a tent.
br,A tent?
ny,Yes <laughter>.
sd,So I guess we really rough it.
b,Really.
sd,And we really enjoy that.
sd,"Uh, one thing, uh, I've done all sorts of camping."
sd,"I've, I've camped, uh, in the snow on a glacier."
sd,"I've camped, uh, basically almost anywhere, even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that, that camping trip and had to pack it back out."
bf,So you're a serious camper.
aa,"Well, we enjoy it, yeah."
sd,"But since I've been married and with a family, uh, we have to go where there's restrooms <laughter>."
ba,"Well, that makes sense."
+,"And playgrounds, and so forth,"
sd,"so, we really enjoy it."
sd,"But also while I was growing up, we did have a trailer,"
sd,"and, uh, I camped in that trailer and in a tent and in, in log cabins and so forth too."
sd,So a lot of different things.
%,"And yes,"
%,"I, -"
sd,"to answer your questions earlier, yes, I, we do enjoy fishing,"
sd,and I do go fishing.
sd,Haven't done a whole lot down here.
sd,"We recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in, uh, northern Utah down to here because of work, and, uh, haven't been able to enjoy fishing like I used to up there, which is, uh, clear water fishing and streams and, and rivers."
qy,"But when you all went camping is that what you normally, I mean, -"
qw,what did you normally do?
sd,"We normally, yeah, -"
sd,"we did, we did a lot of the fishing,"
sd,"but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and, and just going out and seeing what there was to see, uh, in the area."
sv,"I guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with where, what you're going to do when you go,"
sd,and you do actually camp.
aa,"Oh, yes."
aa,"That's true,"
aa,that's true.
qy,"Did you ever like travel around to what's that, the little K O, K O A camps whenever -- -"
sd,we --
qy,-- ever done that?
+,-- never did that.
%,They <laughter> -
sd,"although I've stayed in K O A campgrounds, uh, we've never done that just to go around and camp."
sd,"Um, personally, I, when I, when we were growing up and when we were going camping, I thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Um, you know, that was mainly for people in motor homes or, or had trailers or, and so on and so forth, where, you know, we really wanted to go camping in a tent --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, uh, K O A is, is geared for the people that have a # hookup. #"
bf,"# That actually # travel, what, city to city, state to state."
aa,"Right,"
aa,"exactly,"
sd,"and, uh, I started out basically camping when I was, when I was in Boy Scouts,"
sd,"and we did an awful lot of that as, as a Boy Scout group."
sd,"As I mentioned earlier, we went into wilderness areas"
sd,"and we camped in the snow, and in, uh, snow caves,"
%,"and, and, uh, -"
sd,"That's probably where I first started, was in Girl Scouts."
b,All right.
qy,"And you got a lot of that in, huh?"
ny,Yeah
x,<laughter>.
qw,<Laughter> What do you like to do when you go camping?
sd,"Um, well, let's see. I just, I mean, I just like to go"
sd,"and, normally I go with a whole group of friends --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff.
qy,"Enjoy it, huh <laughter>."
sd,Roast marshmallows.
bf,"Tell scary, or scary stories around the fire"
%,"and, -"
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"or, um, take a deck of cards if we can actually see and, um, play cards and stuff."
b,"<Laughter> Oh, yeah."
sd,"You know, lots, a lot of people I've talked to have said, well, isn't camping boring?"
^q,"Don't you get, don't you, uh, get bored and not have anything to do,"
sd,"but I've found out that actually we, we really enjoy getting away from the television, the telephone --"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,it's relaxing.
aa,"-- and, yes."
aa,Exactly.
sd,"Get out, -"
sd,getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping.

sv,I think that's regressive
sv,"and, uh, uh, it's kind of dumb."

qh,"what I don't know, is where do we draw the line."
b,Right.
qy,"Uh, do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime,"
qrr,or do we extend it beyond that?
b,"Uh-huh,"
br,beyond murder or just beyond like first degree murder?
no,"Well, either, you know."
sd,"Uh, I have a, a nine year old daughter,"
sv,"and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes, that, that I would consider basis for murder."
b,Yeah.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,well that really gets into a sticky issue.
sd,"Uh, I could see that too."
sv,"I think there's probably things I could think of short of murder that someone, I think someone would probably deserve to be killed for."
ba,"But, gosh,"
qh,"and who's going to decide which is how bad, you know, -"
sv,"something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me,"
sv,"and, uh, it's gets into a pretty sticky issue."
aa,"Yes,"
aa,it does.
sv,"A lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and, um, to what's allowable and where are we."
b,Right.
sv,"Uh, you know, if we were, lived in a different country, then murder is not so bad."
b,<Laughter> Yeah.
sv,"But over here, where we're promised the civil liberties of purs-, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, then taking that away is a, a heinous act."
b,"Yeah,"
^2,in some eyes.
sv,I think some people give up that <laughter>.
sv,"I think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than, than what most people think of them as."
sd,"I don't know what, um, Texas's criteria for capital murder is, do, capital punishment is,"
qy,do you know?
qy,"Are there some set guidelines, like only under these circumstances?"
h,I don't know.
sv,"I believe it's, uh, at the discretion of the judge or jury."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I used to live in Virginia,"
sd,"and I know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only, um, if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder."
sv,"Those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty, which I think is a little too limited."
aa,I tend to agree with you there.
sv,"Um, my belief is that, is that, um, any crime that's freely committed, you know -"
%,freedom of choice -- -
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- these people had a choice of committing this crime, that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- such as rape, deserves punishment by death."
sd,But then I'm also told that I'm a pretty harsh person.
b,"<Laughter> Yeah,"
sd,"in general terms I'm not so harsh,"
sd,"but then whenever I hear of a specific case, you know, where someone did something, then it's like, yeah, put it to them <laughter>."
sd,"So, I think I probably tend to be a little bit harsh, too, as far as that goes."
%,"Because, -"
%,"yeah,"
aa,"I think you're right,"
sv,"that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime,"
sv,"they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life,"
%,"just beca-, you know, -"
sv,they ruin someone else's life.
b,"All right,"
sd,I can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food --
b,Right.
+,"-- than a person who commits a crime to, either for the thrill of committing the crime or the thrill, the feeling of power that they get from it, or to acquire drugs for some other, I mean acquire funds for some other illegal activity."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"You know, that second group of people falls into the group that I say give up their rights,"
sd,"the, the first guy, you know I just assumed it was a guy, the first person,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"that went out to rob a store for food, that to me is, is a different set of circumstances, where he, he deserves help instead of, uh, loss of life."
b,Right.
x,<Throat_clearing>.
b,"Yeah,"
aa,That's right
%,"or with the, -"
qh,"What about, uh, like teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that. Say fifteen, sixteen year old."
qy,"Would you consider, uh, capital punishment for them?"
sv,I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen.
b,<Laughter> Uh-huh.
%,"There's some, -"
h,"and I, I certainly don't know myself,"
sv,"but somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include the, the consideration of, of long term consequences --"
b,Right.

b,"Yeah,"
^2,"what age they're accountable,"
+,for their actions.
sd,"and, uh, well he's nineteen now,"
sd,"and I don't think that I saw it in him until maybe last year,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"And I have an eleven year old and a nine year old,"
sd,"and I don't, don't see it in them yet,"
sd,"but I'm, I'm not sure where it begins."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"I know that they are lowering the age of, uh, whatever is considered a minor."
sv,"I think the kids, certain kids have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be,"

"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",All right.
qw,"What, what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation?"
sv,I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force.
b,Yeah.
sv,"Few are, uh, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively."
aa,Uh-huh.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"I, I, I grew up in, uh, sixties and early seventies"
sd,"and, uh, my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up."
sd,"She didn't start working until I was, um, well into high school."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"So, I, I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids, it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,true.
sd,"Well, mine taught kindergarten"
sd,"but she was always, uh, -"

b,Huh.
b,"Um,"
ba,# That's unusual <laughter>. #

sv,"it's, and it's, I think it's kind of a new movement"
sv,"it's going back towards, you know, -"
sd,"women have come into the work force in the last twenty, thirty years"
sv,"and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where, you know, women stayed home with the kids, you know, and try to give the kids quality time."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And I, I think that in the future you're, I think you're going to see a lot more, um, women choosing to not work after they have a baby."
b,Yeah.
sv,"Um, I think with, uh, the, uh, the work force with the, the salaries that -"
sd,"a lot of, a lot of the women that I work for have husbands who are, um, vice-presidents of companies"
sv,"and I think with, uh, um, this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# um, # I don't see it as much, the, like in my situation where I don't, I don't have children yet,"
sd,but ideally I would like to be able to stay home with my kids.
sv,"But realistically that's, I'm, I'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,that is tough.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"we're looking at that now,"
sd,my wife's about six months along.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"You know, it's going to kind of <throat_clearing> kind of go along with the B M W in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever."
ba,True.
sv,"Um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever."
aa,Yeah.
sd,I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home.
sv,I would think it would be women that were working full-time.
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"believe it or not though the, all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home."
b,Huh.
sv,"Um, they're real active in volunteer work."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Um, one of the women is real active with, uh, Muscular Dystrophy. And, uh, does a lot of, of work with them on a volunteer basis"
sv,"but it's still, it's almost like a job,"
sd,she just doesn't get paid for it.
sv,"Huh. Well, I guess that's good that they, they've got something to keep them active."
aa,Yeah.
qy,"When, when your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home"
qrr,"or is she going to,"
ny,"# Yeah,"
sd,"we're, #"

qo,<<Very faint>> What do you think?
%,"That, that, that, -"
sd,"I would, I would like to be able to do that."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"we think it's, uh, that important"
sd,"and I, I kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction."
sd,"I'm a, a counselor and a therapist,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# and # I work with adolescents,"
sd,and I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"I, I see a difference in the generation of, even the generation before me,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# uh, # were, you know, mom was like, um, Mrs Cleaver, uh, you know, June Cleaver or whatever,"
sv,"where the, the attitudes were a lot different."

sv,"um, ther-, there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# um, # a lot of the, the things that are going on in today's society,"
sv,"I think morally, um, it seems like there was, peo-, people were a lot better back then as far as hig-, higher standards."
ba,True.
sv,"Well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure"
sv,and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too.
b,Yeah.
sv,"So, kids are raised around their friends and by the media."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,that's true.
sv,"And that's, you know, that's contributed,"
sv,"And I think, I think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time,"
sv,"so. If there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work, you know,"
sv,"there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in computers at home,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# and # those types of things, that would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap <<pause>>."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"I, I think that, um, in the future, um, the, the family unit as it, as it once was known, is, is going to be nonexistent <<pause>>."
qo,"What, how do you, what do you think?"
qw,About?
%,That as far as -
qy,"do-, do you think there's going to be still a family unit"
qrr,"or, or do you think that, um, the trend is going more towards single parenting?"
%,The <laughter> (( balance )) -
%,"I don't, -"
sd,"the, the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so"
sd,and it got higher than that for a while.
sv,"Um, that's hard to say."
sv,Families are such a strange configuration anymore.
sd,"Um, I, I see a lot of families where, -"
%,"you know, in the, in the back, -"
sd,"I grew up about the same time you did,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sv,# and # back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, nowadays it's not the case,"
sv,"kids don't, kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk"
sv,"and one of the reasons, I guess, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working."
sv,They get bombarded with junk
sv,and they don't have to do anything around the house.
sv,"They never learned to be responsible when, -"
b,# Yeah. #
sv,# the # bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while -
sv,"and they come back,"
sv,and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad <laughter>
%,"so, -"
b,# Yeah. #
sv,"# you # know, you create a bigger, bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose."
b,Yeah.
sv,"So. It's not, not a real functional situation anyway."
sd,"So, you know, I don't know it's, I don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families"
sv,"and the (( )) families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"I, I think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore."
sv,"(( )) like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are, um, you know, two parent families."
b,Uh-huh.
ba,That's pretty sad.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,"it is,"
sv,"I guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what's important to people, you know, probably keep going downhill."
h,"And I, I don't know"
sv,"we, we feel like that, that we can make it on one income"
sv,"it, it may be tough"
sv,"but we may have to give up on some, some things."
sv,"I, I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that."
b,Yeah.
sv,"And it will, it will make the, the strain worthwhile."
aa,"Yeah,"

qo,How do you feel about credit cards?
sd,"<Laughter> Personally, I do not care for them. Uh, although I find them a necessity in business and so forth,"
sd,"I, I try to refrain from their use as much as possible. Um, for a number of reasons, one of which is the, you know, extreme interest rate on most of them."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"The one I use, uh, of course, for mostly, only for business purposes is, uh, you know, American Express."
b,Right.
sd,"And, uh, <breathing> I'm not <breathing> I'm not terribly in favor of them."
sd,"Not for my own personal, uh, point of view."
b,Right.
sd,"Plus it, uh, has, you know, from an economic point of view it has increased our debt --"
b,Yeah.
+,-- tremendously --
b,Right.
+,"-- to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion, I believe --"
ba,Wow.
sd,"-- uh, at least that's one number for this range of numbers I have, I have heard."
b,Right.
qy,Do you use them frequently
%,"or, -"
sd,"Well, we, uh, me and my wife, when, when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have, and we can put it in our budget, yeah, we'll, we'll use it."
sd,"But like last year, I think we paid, -"
sd,"I think it was like twenty something cents interest,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,on our Visa.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And I think this, this year we, uh, I think we used it for Christmas,"
sd,and we got caught just a few days on our grace period.
sd,"And, uh, so we'll pay a little interest this year, but maybe two dollars."
sd,But we don't like to do that at all.
b,Yes.
sd,"And, you know, we, I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly."
sd,"We, uh, we have several credit cards, though."
sd,"We have a gas card, our Visa, and then, of course, the American Express,"
sd,and I think we have a couple of department stores.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, we use it the same way,"
%,"and, uh, -"
sd,"I find the one I use mostly, uh, -"
sd,"aside from the American Express, I do use my Sears card."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, uh, I try, a-, as with the American Express, I try to pay it, you know, as it comes in."
b,Right.
b,Right.
%,"So, uh, -"
sd,"It's, it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill."
sd,That's usually how we do it.
sd,"I know when I travel, or when I used to travel overseas quite a bit, what I would do on my American Express card is before I would, before I left I would mail a check to, to American Express --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and, you know, have some idea of how much was there, you know, I'd sent them, you know, several hundred dollars, or whatever --"
b,Uh-huh.

b,Yeah.

b,Yeah.

sd,I knew --
b,Right.

b,Yeah.

sd,"Sometimes, you know, sometimes I would go over,"
sd,"but it wouldn't, you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big, in a big way because --"
b,Right.

b,Right.
ba,That's good.
sd,"I've, I don't think we've gone that far (( )) <laughter>,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"to pay it in ad-, you know, in advance before we spend it,"
sv,"but, I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it, that, like that,"
sd,"Well, I found --"
+,that may be good.
+,"-- I found in, um, in traveling overseas --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- that, uh, often it would, uh, it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card --"
b,Oh really.
+,-- for hotel bills and so forth.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Plus I would, uh, when they, uh, would send the bill, they would automatically convert to the exchange rate."
b,"Right,"
b,right.
sd,"So, now, the only time that got to be a problem was, if the exchange rate changed drastically."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, for example, I remember on one trip to France <breathing> when I started planning the trip, I think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And whe-, when I finally got over there, it had fallen, uh, two or three francs to the dollar."

ba,Wow <laughter>.

b,Yeah.

sd,"if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night --"
b,Right.

sd,maybe it would be more than that.
sd,It was more than.
sd,It would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night --
b,Right.

b,Right.
sd,But then <laughter> when I got back and I was working for the government at the time -- -
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- of course the government was several months behind in,"
b,"Right,"
b,yeah.

b,Yeah.

aa,Right.
aa,Yeah

sd,<Laughter> That was the only time I really got caught short.

h,"<sniffing> I don't know,"

b,"Uh-huh,"

h,"and <sniffing> I don't know,"

b,Huh.

qo,"# Well what about, # uh, required drug testing, uh, as a, uh, condition of employment?"
^h,"<Sniffing> Yeah,"
sd,"that was, that, that was the other one I was thinking of <sniffing>."

sd,I mean I know # drugs <noise> are illegal. #
%,# It (( )) thing # actually. -
sd,"Uh, I, uh, have worked at Texas Instruments."
b,<Noise> Huh. Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, they instituted a drug policy there. Drug testing policy where they randomly would test, uh, employees --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and actually, to tell you the truth, I really did not think much about it."
sd,"I, I hadn't, you know,"
sd,it really didn't relate to me.
qh,"But there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have."
b,<Talking> Uh-huh.
sv,"And, <throat_clearing> also, uh, uh, this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing, this kind of big brother activity"
sv,"and yet, uh, a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments, although they don't admit to it, it's actually, oh, a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"So <throat_clearing> what that means is, to me, that really it's the government that's requiring this,"
sv,"although they don't actually e-, execute it themselves, it's really the government that (( )) . -"
sv,"So, in that sense, it, at least, philosophically, it's really borderline legal."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Well <talking> I, I think the, I think that, you know, a person's competence should be more determined by, you know, their actions and their behavior"
sv,"and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know, contol-, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who is able to evaluate them."
sv,"I think they should be evaluated that way rather than <sniffing> with a, you know, a chemical, # you know, #"
qh,"# Well, what about # this, uh, AIDS epidemic now?"

qo,# So what # about that as an invasion of privacy?
^h,Yeah.
sv,"Wel-, I guess it kind of borders on where, I mean what do you value more. The invasion of, uh, the person's privacy or the possible danger to, you know, other people."
b,"So really,"
bf,"it i-, gets to balancing, uh, personal freedom against, uh, the general welfare --"
aa,Yeah.
+,-- of society.
sv,"I guess that's alwa-, that's been the big role of government, I guess <laughter>. # I mean generally. #"
sv,"# Well, it, it's supposed # to have been."
aa,Yeah
aa,<laughter>. Yeah.
sv,"Well, that's kind of a difficult one to go into."
sv,"I mean that, that particular case."
ar,"<Throat_clearing> (( No,"
%,"it )) , -"
sv,"Because I mean, there's a lot of people that, uh, I mean they could require, you know, <swallowing> ob-, obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because I'm, you know, there's a huge part of the population,"
sv,"not a huge part but a, you know -- -"
^2,A growing part.
sv,"-- the AIDS population I guess that have it, that don't know they do --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- are spreading it.
sv,"But, again, to require, you know, such a test and jus-, and then to make, make it (( )) is to subject them to, to discrimi-, discriminatory practices and other things."
h,"I don't know,"
sd,"uh, I don't know how exactly I feel about that."
sv,(( Maybe )) chop their weenies off.
sd,I guess we're ready to talk.
fp,"How you doing, Howard?"
sd,"This is a, a subject that I'm not real well versed on,"
%,but. -
ad,"Well, let's talk about air pollution."
aa,Okay.
qw,What do you think causes air pollution in Dallas?
qw,Or where are you from?
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",No.
qy^d,Maybe you're not in Dallas.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Okay,"
sd,"I'm from the, uh, -"
sd,I'm from Dallas.
sd,I'm in Richardson.
bk,"Okay. Uh,"
qo,What do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area?
sd,"Well, I have some small experience in this area."
sd,The brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown --
b,Right.
+,"-- a lot of that is, uh, tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates."
sd,"But, uh, the, one of the major problems that Dallas has is oxides and nitrogen."
sd,"That's because of all the equipment that's being operated. But at the same time, uh, because we don't have, we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we,"
x,<Throat_clearing>.
+,don't get a lot of particulates.
sd,Now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in Dallas.
b,Right.
sd,"Uh, power plants since, -"
x,<Throat_clearing>.
sd,"many of our local power plants, uh, are natural gas most of the time, uh, the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide, and N O X."
sd,"There's no particulates in natural gas, of course."
sd,And we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products.
sd,"We're burning fuel oil and a few other things,"
sd,"but gasoline, of course, now the lead's out, at least theoretically, uh, I guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur."
sd,That's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter --
bh,"Oh, really?"
+,"-- the sulphur, yes."
sd,"And that's, uh, course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor --"
b,Sure.
+,-- and that goes back in with your sulphur
sd,and under the right condition you get H two S.
%,"But, anyway, uh, -"
sv,"Well, you are, you are well versed on the subject, I tell you."
bd,"Well, I don't know."
sd,This is not one of my better ones.
sd,"I guess, <throat_clearing> I guess I notice it the most just, uh, in driving around Dallas with all the, <inhaling> the highway equipment that's working on the --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- on, six thirty-five and seventy-five, just the cars in general."
sd,That's where I see most of it.
%,"Ro-, -"
sd,"uh, Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is."
b,Right.
sd,"And when they run rich they, they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons,"
sd,and that's another part of the problem.
sd,The gas is not being burned completely.
sd,"But, uh, hopefully, if we ever get our road system fixed up, this will get a lot better."
sd,"Oh, I don't know, I've lived here since seventy-four, Howard,"
sd,"and, I d-, I think, I think they been working on the highways around here since I've been here,"
x,<Laughter>.
sv,"and I think, I think they'll be working on them long after my wife and I are gone."
sd,"Well, I guess, I, not trying to top you, but I grew up in Dallas county and I can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of --"
b,Right <laughter>.
+,-- Central
sd,"and, uh, I can remember coming over the hill down there long about, uh, I don't know, little bit north of mark-, Mockingbird on up in, over those hills"
sd,and I said I wonder if they'll ever need this road.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"Course, it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and are, off ramps,"
ba,"but, gosh,"
sv,"seems like, uh, those ramps might kill us yet."
%,"I, -"
sd,hopefully the new ones will be a lot better.
ba,I understand.
sd,"I sure hope so, I tell you."
sd,"You know, you get out on the, uh, interstate highways versus, -"
sd,I travel quite a bit
sd,"and traveling from, like, Dallas to Austin to San Antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles in the, in the stalled traffic and the busy highways, you, you, you're at your best"
sd,"and, I guess when you're out on the interstate, <inhaling> heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars"
%,"and, -"
b,"Yeah,"
qy,"Ron, have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty-five, I guess towards Waxahachie, Hillsborough on down to Austin,"
x,<Noise>.
+,"you hit a point down there about, I think where they call Bear Creek exit --"
ny,Yes.
+,-- on just this side of the county line <static>.
sd,"Right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner."
qy,Have you noticed that?
ng,"I tell you what, I, I don't think I really have,"
sd,but I'm going that way Tuesday
oo_co_cc,and I'm going to make it a point to.
sd,"Well, sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing --"
b,Sure.
sd,"-- but, uh, I also travel a little bit"
sd,"and, uh, I don't know, it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier."
sd,It may be all in my mind.
aa,"Oh, I know."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"I know going to, uh, uh, -"
sd,"I detest going to Houston because it's such a, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Uh, Greg,"
sd,"uh, I, I'm not familiar."
qy,"I think, uh, you guys in Indiana, don't you have the, the death penalty?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,we do have the death penalty here.
sd,"It's not exercised very often,"
sd,but we do have it.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I believe it, -"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I know there's a lot of, lot of problems with it,"
sv,"but, uh --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that, that the person just, I feel, doesn't deserve to live, doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in, in prison for life."
aa,Right.
sd,"But, I know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you declare someone, put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,"
sv,but --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- just seems like in some cases that it's a, it's a good policy."
aa,Uh-huh.
aa,"Uh, I, I tend to agree with you,"
sd,"uh, <throat_clearing> I've changed my views over, uh, e-, even within the last few years, uh, to be honest."
sd,"Uh, <throat_clearing> uh, when I was in coll-, when I was an undergraduate, I was a member of Amnesty International --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, uh, and, of course, at that time, you know, I thought, uh, uh, it was stupid to kill anybody for, uh, -"
%,"you know, that -"
sv,the eye for an eye was a stupid argument.
aa,Right.
sv,"But <throat_clearing> the, uh, the more, -"
sd,"now I live in downtown Dallas,"
sd,"and I, uh, <throat_clearing> --"
b,Right.
+,"-- you know, I've seen, uh, I've seen cases on, in the news and all where, where, you know, uh, a, a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder."
b,Right.
sv,"<Sniffing> I think that <throat_clearing> maybe, uh, a good solution to capital punishment might be, uh, reserve it solely for, uh, repeat offenders of a crime like, uh, murder."
aa,"That's a, that's a thought that I had never really had on that --"
b,"Yeah,"
+,-- which seems pretty sensible.
sv,it seems sensible and failsafe.
%,"I, I, uh, I don't, -"
sv,"you know, not completely failsafe,"
sv,"but if a man's convicted of two murders, uh, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong."
aa,Right.
%,"Uh <inhaling> <throat_clearing> I also, uh, -"
sv,"to tell you how liberal I have turned, uh, toward this, or, or, or whatever side that is --"
b,Right.
b,<laughter> Yeah.
+,"-- I've kind of chosen, uh, I believe it that, uh, big time drug importers, like, uh, say Noriega for example --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- that these people need to be, uh, eliminated, uh --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- from society,"
sv,"and I think, I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, uh, really any kind of, uh, uh, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, uh, create another power structure <laughter>."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,"you're, you're right there."
%,"Uh, I gue-, -"
sd,"basically my views, I guess they tend to be more economically oriented --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- in that I just, you know, they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars, taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail --"
b,Right.
+,"-- when they're going to be there for life, they're never going to be rehabilitated."
b,Right.
sv,"I mean, I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with --"
b,Right.
sv,"-- so to me I'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- to keep somebody alive who I, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,"
sv,"so I, I'm all in favor of it."
b,Uh-huh.
qy,"Well, uh, <throat_clearing> do you, uh, -"
qy,"are there cases where you think that, that, uh, the capital, the capital punishment shouldn't be, uh, uh, sentenced?"
h,"Well, I, I really don't know on that question."
sv,"It just seems like, -"
sv,"for instance, the Jeffrey Dahlmer case. I mean, I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society."
sv,I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and in that case, Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,"
sd,so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment --
b,Right.
sv,"-- and I think that, that he should not be allowed to live,"
sv,"but, you know, then you're kind of playing God <laughter> --"
aa,"That's true,"
aa,yeah.
+,"-- which is n-, never a good thing to do."
aa,Right.
sd,"But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, uh, not really that I can think of."
sv,"I, I would, I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- serial killers --
b,Uh-huh.
ar,"-- uh, I don't really agree with the, uh, death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that."
sv,"I think that they're, they're operating on a more, -"
sv,"I mean, I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,"
sv,"but I don't really think that, that it's, it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because --"
b,Right.
+,-- they're feeding our consumer needs.
b,"Sure,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"I understand, I understand your point."
%,Yeah.
qy^d,"Uh, of course, you know, with, uh, with, with Dahlmer now, uh, you, you realize that Ohi-, I think it's Ohio, uh, gets to try him next"
sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- they do have the death penalty.
b,Yeah.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"<inhaling> <throat_clearing> so, uh, that was a curious case."
%,I. -
b,"Yeah,"
sd,that is very curious.
sv,"Uh, uh, something is sort of nightmarish --"
aa,Yeah.
+,-- to say the least.
aa,"That's, that's right."
sd,"Uh, well, here in Texas we, uh, -"
sd,"I think even, even this last week, last week they had another, they, uh, -"
sd,"you know, they use their capital punishment by lethal injection, uh, uh,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Okay,"
sd,it's pressed.
qy,Are you still there?
na,I'm ready <laughter>.
bk,Okay <laughter>.
qw,"So what's, uh, things that you look for when you go out to dinner?"
sd,"Oh, I just like a nice, quiet, nice atmosphere --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- and of course good food <laughter>.
sd,"That's always, that's always a concern, but just a nice quiet easy place --"
b,Huh.
+,-- maybe candlelight something --
+,"-- just to relax, you know --"
+,"-- because I don't really go out to dinner that much,"
%,so. -
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Well, we don't go out to dinner that much either."
sd,We try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- something like that,"
sd,"but I definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean, you know."
b,Right.
sd,"Um, I've been to some that's been terrible."
sv,"You know, you see cockroaches crawling around and --"
b,Oh <laughter>.
+,"-- <Laughter> everything, you know."
sd,But I try to get one that's nice and clean
sd,"and then I like to, you know, good food and good service."
b,Yeah.
%,So. -
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"where you don't feel rushed, you know --"
b,"Yeah,"
b,right.
sv,"-- and you can just relax, and --"
b,"Right,"
b,right.
+,-- stay as long as you want.
qy,So is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano?
na,"Well, nearby."
sd,We're almost in Dallas.
sd,We're just north of Dallas.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,So we have quite a bit between us and there.
sd,It's about ten miles --
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,-- and there is all kinds of restaurants
sd,"and, I had one that was a favorite for a long time,"
sd,and then it changed hands and doubled the prices
sd,and then it finally went out of business.
b,Um.
sd,"So, but it was really nice."
sd,It had a fireplace.
ba,"Um, that sounds beautiful."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,it was really nice.
sd,They had entertainment sometimes
sd,and --
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,-- you could just really relax there and enjoy it.
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,Well.
sd,But it's gone <laughter>.
+,This is only a little small city.
%,"Uh, we have, uh, <cough> -"
sd,"excuse me, <cough> I didn't think my coughing would come back."
sd,"Anyhow, we have only like one, uh, restaurant that's kind of nice."
sd,"You know, they have prime rib on, uh, weekends --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and then they have about six miles from here is called, a little city called Wesley,"
sd,"and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food,"
sd,"and the atmosphere there is really, really nice."
ba,"Oh, that's nice."
sd,"So, and then if we really want to, you know, something different we go to Modesto --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- which is like twenty minutes away.
b,Right.
sd,"But, uh, we don't have any fast foods here in this small city <laughter>."
sv,That is probably very fortunate for you.
qy,Do you have kids?
br,Do I have kids?
ny,Yeah.
na,"Well, I have a son,"
sd,but he's grown up.
sd,"Oh, because I have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night, you know,"
sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- now's she's graduated to two cheeseburgers,"
sd,"<laughter> so something's happened here,"
sd,"but, but, um, you know, McDonald's is definitely at the top of her list,"
sd,and I hate these places.
b,Yeah.
qy,"All the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they, you know."
ny,"Uh-huh,"
na,"they do,"
sv,and I don't think there's an ounce of <laughter> nutritional value in anything they have.
aa,"No,"
aa,"no,"
sd,I'm sure there isn't.
sd,"Well, we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- and it's really, it's tempting when you come home from work"
sv,and you're tired
sv,"and, you know, you just are tempted to give in to that,"
sv,and it costs a lot of money to do it too.
ba,# I know. #
sv,"# You know, it # adds up"
sv,"and it's not healthy,"
sd,"and I really got into that habit for a while,"
sd,but I got out of it again because --
b,Yeah.

b,Yeah.

b,Uh-huh.
%,So. -
qw,"Well, let's see, what else can we talk about? <laughter>."
qo,"<Laughter> Well, how's California today? <laughter>."

bh,Is it?
sd,"That's what I've heard, yeah."

b,Yeah

qy,Have you always lived there?
na,I came from Iowa when I was sixteen --

qy^d,And you like it?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,I like it real well.
b,"Yeah,"
%,we've been.
sd,"We used to live in Oakland,"
sd,so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there --
b,"Oh, yeah."
+,"-- you know,"
sd,"but, uh, then I quit work and everything"
sd,and I bought a house.
sd,"I had a condo in Oakland,"
sd,"so, right in Chinatown, so we went to lots of restaurants --"
ba,"Oh, that would be fun."

sd,I really miss them. # You know. #
b,# Yeah.

b^m,# No. #

b,Yeah.

b,Yeah.
sd,"But, uh, as far as missing living there, no."
%,Um.
sd,"It's close enough if I wanted to go there, to San Francisco for dinner or something, why, you know, an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, have dinner and then come on back."
qy,"But, uh, have you ever been to California?"
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
sd,I go all the time.
bh,Oh really?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,well I have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there --
%,Um.
sd,"-- and she, um, is a world champion twirler --"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,So I went out a lot with her.
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
ny,"And, uh, yeah,"
sd,I know California pretty well.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And I love it, #"
sd,and # --

sd,but I think he's going to move because I'm the person with more to lose here.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,I have my twelve year old in school --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and she's happy.
sd,"She always lived here in the south,"
sd,"and I have my house,"
sd,so --
b,Uh-huh.

"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
qw,What do you think of the public school system?
qy,"First off, do you have children that are in it?"
na,I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems
sd,"and I am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school,"
bk,"# Oh, okay <laughter>. #"

%,"So, # -"
sv,"Well then, you should be a good one to know because I, my children are grown now."

b,# Oh. #
+,# in the # school system
sd,"so, uh, I don't have firsthand experience right now,"
b,"# Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh. #
+,# with it. #
qo,So what do you think?
sv,"Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job."
sv,I think they have a long way to go yet
sv,"but I think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier."
sd,"You know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers,"
sv,and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done.
sv,"And I think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills."
b,# Right. #
sv,you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together.
sv,"And I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think,"
sv,they literally cannot come in out of the rain.
aa,<Laughter> That's right <laughter>.
%,"You know, and that just, -"
sv,I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot <laughter> make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted.
b,# Right. #
sd,"# And, uh, # this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education."
sv,"So I think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have,"
sv,"and I think that's very, very important."
aa,"Yes,"
aa,it is.
sv,"I, I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren, -"
sd,"we have a, uh, fourth grader"
sd,and then we have one that's in kindergarten
sd,"and, and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade."
b,"Oh, yeah."
x,<Sniffing>.
b,"# Oh, yeah. #"
sd,I tutor a girl that's in eighth grade
sd,"and her pre-algebra book is higher then <laughter> some of my Algebra Two,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,when I was in high school.
qy,# Is that scary?
x,<Laughter>. #
sd,"# And it's like, oh, I going to take this home and study it # before I can help you."
b,# Right. #
sd,"# You know, # so they're really, they're really moving them along"
sd,"but yet, <sniffing> at the same time, you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life."
%,"# Now, # -"
%,"# And # that's wha-, you know, -"
sd,a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use.
b,Yes.
sv,"And, uh, so I think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this."
aa,<Laughter> Correct.
qy,"Are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time?"
sd,"Um, I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms."
ny,"Yes,"
%,"# that's a, # -"

qy,"are you, do you find that?"
sd,"<Sniffing> Well, filling out the forms and also all of these, uh, statewide and national wide testing,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# things # so that they compare
sv,"and (( )) . You know, you can as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it.
sv,"And you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be,"
%,"# Be, -"
b,uh-huh. #

x,<laughter>.

sd,"You know, the fir-, the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review"
sd,"but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in,"
^2,"# Coming up,"
b,uh-huh. #

sv,but I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous.
sv,It's like bragging on your grandchildren.
b,Right <laughter>.
sv,"You know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth"
sv,"and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this,"
sd,and that's great.
sv,But that's what they're doing with the school systems
sv,"and they're wasting too much time on that, # I think. #"
sd,"# Well, I, # I know that this again this, this friend,"
x,<Sniffing>.
+,"uh, is in the Plano School District,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# and # she teaches, uh, uh, it mus-, uh, emotionally disturbed children."
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# And she says # she has, um, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade."
b,Yes.
x,<Sniffing>.
sv,But because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something.
h,I didn't quite understand it.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"there's a, -"
%,yeah.
%,"# And, uh, # -"
sv,"# The bottom # line is always money,"
qy,"Well, have you ever served on a jury?"
nn,"No,"
sd,I've not.
sd,"I've been called,"
sd,but I had to beg off from the duty.
qy,And you?
na,"Well, I was called"
sd,and then I was not chosen.
%,Um.
sv,"Well, I was, I was, uh, originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow"
sv,and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.
sd,I don't know why.
sd,Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago.
bh,"Oh, really?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,"
sd,and <inhaling> they kind of liked me.
sd,"I looked conser-, <breathing> and all that stuff"
%,"and they, -"
sd,"I don't know what they saw in me,"
sd,but they saw it.
sd,"But, uh, back to the issue, is, uh, -"
h,"I don't know,"
sv,"at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun."
sv,"But, there, too, there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, I think in civil cases."
sv,"In criminal cases, I'd like to see the unani-, unanimity remain,"
sv,"but in civil cases, I think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient."
qo,"Well, uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that?"
sv,"Well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this."
sd,"And in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, <breathing> misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that."
sv,"A majority rule, I think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases."
h,I don't know if I'm making any sense or not.
sv,"Well, I mean, I think, -"
qy,"are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, uh, tangible"
%,"or, -"
ny,"Yeah,"
sv,often there's more incriminating evidence.
ad,"Like, for instance, say, uh, -"
sv,"and also, too, I think I'm, I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, uh, serious in a criminal case."
qy,"Well, do you think that, that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up?"
^h,"Um, well, I really can't say for certain, truth be known."
sv,"Uh, as it stands, there's, there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, uh, in a ((civil)), uh, civil and criminal case."
sv,"I mean, the, uh, documentary, the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that."
qy^d,"You know, I don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not."
nn,"No,"
sd,I'm not.
sd,"A, uh, fellow <breathing> when he was much younger, uh, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death."
sd,"Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked"
sd,"and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system."
sd,The case was reopened
sd,and he was exonerated.
sv,"Well, I mean, I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"many laws, but little justice."
%,"Say, -"
%,"but, uh, -"
sv,"and I also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective."
aa,"Oh, certainly not,"
aa,certainly not.
sv,"And <breathing>, you know, they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this,"
sv,but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.
%,"You know, the, -"
sd,because you get up
sd,"and, and <breathing> they ask you a few questions,"
sd,"both sides do,"
sd,"and <breathing> then you, you're either challenged which is, -"
sd,"you know, each attorney can use that as much as they like"
sd,"or, I think it's a limit now,"
sv,"they probably have a limit now,"
sd,"but, they pretty much go through that,"
sd,and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve.
sd,"For me, it was financial hardship,"
sd,"so. But, onto the thing, uh, I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing."
sd,"It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say."
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Okay,"
ad,"we, we can, uh, be recorded while we talk about it."
aa,"Okay,"
qy,"well is your, -"
qy,"does your city have mandatory, uh, recycling?"
nn,"No,"
sd,we don't have mandatory.
sv,"We, actually, we're kind of slow up here,"
sd,and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer.
sd,And it's all voluntary.
sd,So that's interesting.
qy,Cities have a mandatory recycling?
na,"Um, there, there're some places that are strongly encouraging it,"
sd,and that they city will pick it up.
sd,That's been one of the arguments here.
sd,I'm just sitting here looking. We've got four bins of glass and plasticine <<phonetically spelled>> stuff.
sd,"But we have to carry it, uh, some distance,"
sd,"and some places, um, you can sell your, uh, recyclables,"
sd,"and, for example, our church was collecting newspapers."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,when I was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing.
sd,We got like a penny a pound for them.
sd,"Well, it turns out that so much,"
sd,"the problem in Texas is that, uh, they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to, uh, reprocess it."
ba,"Oh, my,"
sd,"It requires an ex-, it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it,"
sd,and so the value has gone down.
sd,It turns out it wasn't worth for the church to do.
ba,"Oh, I didn't realize, -"
sv,"you would think, -"
sv,"now up here, I, I suppose they send it all back to the mill"
sd,"and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of, uh. -"
sd,Actually there is one in northern Vermont.
sd,So there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here.
sd,"I didn't think that, -"
sv,"you know, in the large city that if the next recycling, if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away --"
%,"Well,"
+,-- it's a lot of money to transport.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"well see, that's, -"
sd,"in, in Dallas there no plan to build, -"
sd,"I think there, there's some in East Texas there's some pulp mills,"
sd,"but, uh, you have to go to Houston,"
sd,"and, it's interesting,"
sd,and then there's places that will buy metal
sd,and they still buy aluminum can and likes that. *can -> cans ? likes -> like?
qh,"Do you have to buy metal,"
sv,like copper is a very good one to collect.
sv,"Even aluminum,"
%,"yeah,"
%,so. -
qy,"Well, do you do, do you do recycling?"
na,"Uh, we do the recycling,"
sd,and our city will pick up our recyclables.
b,Oh.
sd,They have these little blue bins.
sd,"Um, I don't recycle personally."
sd,"I, I'm saying I want to do it,"
sd,"but, I don't get a lot of magazines,"
sd,"I don't get a, -"
sd,"I don't buy the newspaper,"
sd,"but I do have a lot of, uh, -"
sd,"my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cart-, a lot of different papers and cardboards."
qy,"Well, do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans?"
ny,"Yes,"
sd,but we have a bottle return.
sd,A lot of the northern states and a lot of the Eastern states have bottles.
sd,We've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years.
bf,"Oh, so it's worth taking them back."
sd,"Well, see, we don't have. -"
sd,"We have, we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles."
sv,"Oh, they should definitely get, um, the nickel returnable."
sv,"It's great for the kids, because"
sd,"see, a lot of the kids get the money from it,"
sv,"and it's great for the boy scouts running around, they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes."
sd,"Oh, that's it, -"
%,"you'll, you'll, -"
sd,"there is a down side to all this, you know, about no good deed going unpunished,"
x,<Laughter>
+,"that, uh, my mother sells, um, trees that they make paper out of,"
sd,"and so every time I recycle newspapers, in fact there's a, there's a, uh, -"
sd,"Kimberly and Clark, the makers of kleenex and such --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- has a, uh, a big paper mill."
sd,In fact I almost went to work for them.
sd,I was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me.
sd,It's twenty or thirty miles from my house.
sd,"Every time you recycle, that's one less tree my mother can sell,"
sd,"and, uh. So, it's a question should I be diligent and, um, --"
^2,And recycle.
+,"-- and, and recycle, and put my mother out of her livelihood."
b,"Oh, yes,"
ba,I see that.
sd,"But, it's an interesting point, though, that, you know, everybody's so anxious to recycle,"
sv,"and I suppose it does provide some gainful employment,"
%,"but, -"
^2,But it takes away employment from the resource
%,and its (( )) . -
sv,"Well, but in general I think it's a good idea because --"
aa,"I do, too."
+,"-- like the glass, you can't argue that the glass, -"
sd,"it doesn't biodegrade, and, and, uh, the plastics obviously,"
sd,They don't either <laughter>
sv,So we might as well recycle those.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"like I say, it's not a very controversial thing."
sv,Everyone thinks we should do it.
sv,"It's just that we're so lazy,"
sd,"I mean, like personally, I don't want to clean my, -"
sd,I just have can cat food.
sd,"I don't want to clean the can and take the label off it, and put it in a separate bin."
b,Yeah.
sd,"You know, I'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash."
sd,"Well, that's what we've got."
sd,"We started about, New Year's we decided we'd get ambitious."
sd,"Well, we took one load over there,"
sd,"and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff,"
sd,"and, you know, it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I think I would be like, -"
sd,"when I bring my bottles back. If they're pretty clean and stuff, so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months, -"
sd,"and I get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov-, and bring them over."
sd,"Now, if I had a recycling center and I kept it clean, like if I washed all the cans and things, I wouldn't mind if it sat around too much,"
sd,"but if, if it stunk or something I wouldn't like doing it."
sd,"But, um, I produce quite a bit of trash, -"
sd,"my, you know, house, -"
sd,"and I see it,"
sd,but I don't see so much that I can recycle.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Like I say, it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard."
sd,"I'm not a real plastic person user, but a lot of paper, um, pretty much,"
sd,and I don't know how they sort that.
sd,"But if, if I used a lot of can goods and I do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles, I would think that I wou-, I would have a recycling center."
sd,"But now, it's just me and my husband,"
h,"so, I don't know."
sv,"But every little bit helps,"
^q,right.
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,I know what you're saying.
sd,"But we have, we have a very aggressive recycling at work,"
sd,and I'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin.
sv,"See, some people, it's, the recycle bin is on their way out."
sv,"Instead of carrying your newspapers, when they get done with them at the end of the day, they throw them in the trash."
qy,"Well, do you have separate trash cans at your desk."
nn,"Um, no,"
sd,"we don't,"
sd,"but other, other offices do."
sd,They have a box for papers.
sd,"Well, we have, we have one that's recyclable and, and then for uh, lunch sacks and waste food"
sd,"and they gave us a list of things that aren't re-, -"
sd,and it turns out it's not so bad.
sd,"I, I get a lot of reports that, that are covered in plastic or plas-, like saran wrap or something, anyway,"
sd,"and then, uh, cardboard, there's a few, -"
sd,"it's interesting that we're, we're recycling computer type paper."
b,Yeah.
sd,"And, and, uh, one day they'll pick up, uh, -"
sd,"the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper,"
sd,"and then the next day they'll pick up the other,"
%,so. -
b,Oh.
sd,"Depending on how much, -"
sd,"you know, and there's a lot of, actually, it works pretty well,"
sd,"and then we have a, uh, waste, uh, cans for aluminum in the, in the break areas at work."
sd,"Well, that's, that's a really good idea, because, um, like our, uh, fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit."
b,Yeah.
sv,"And they're thinking about putting a deposit on them, because pretty much you have to, you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans, where they're --"
b,"Yeah,"
+,"-- so much easier just to put a deposit on it, because most, probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits, because they're beer and soda,"
sd,"but when they sell juice, it's some strange quirk in the law, you don't have to have a deposit on it."
sd,"And even like, the, a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it,"
sd,"but if it's got soda in it, it does."
sd,"So, it's a strange."
sd,That's an interesting distinction.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"they should, they should clean, clear that up."
sd,"It wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the, uh, juice cans as easily as the soda."
b,Yeah.
sd,"So, but redemption centers are a big thing up here,"
sd,they get a penny a can they handle.
sd,They give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor.
sv,I think they either get a penny or two pennies a can.
sd,"Well, see, well, see, those of us that don't have state income taxes, -"
sd,yet --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- that's the big debate here in Texas, that the legislature wants to put one in,"
sd,"and, it's interesting what people get upset about,"
sd,"uh, it really is."
qy,"Is bot-, is bottle return down there a heated debate?"
nn,"Well, no,"
bk,"Oh, yeah."
sd,"Well, we, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","well, here you can't drink,"
sd,"We're not civilized now, you can no longer, you cannot drink beer and drive,"
sd,but --
%,Well.
+,"-- but it was, it was actually legal."
b,"Yes,"
sd,"well, I know, I was in Atlanta,"
sd,and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand.
sd,"But here, Let me put that in a paper cup for you."
x,<Laughter>
sd,So that was strange.
sv,"But, I think, -"
sv,"if some people they have, -"
sv,"they say, well, we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these, um, the, the recycle center, you have to deal with the can and then you have to, to recycle it,"
sv,"and, their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- see how they handle it,"
sd,"and see if it's a good way,"
sd,"and then do it that way. Because, as, like I say, people are making money on it."
sv,"Well, you know, the other,"
sd,"The cans do, are worth something."
+,"Well the other thing is, it also is, is a, is a, a good habit, uh, to, uh, just to conserve resources, you know, where they, you know, because you get in the habit of that, you think in terms of, of, uh, of, of things like saving"
x,(( )) .
sd,"Uh, well I mean I've had time to think about it because, uh, we've had, -"
%,"uh, i-, -"
%,"i-, -"
sd,there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to
sd,so.
b,"Oh, okay."
+,"So, um, I, I was thinking about a couple things, uh --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- and whether they are serious.
sv,Some things are serious
sv,and some aren't.
sv,"I guess the biggest thing that bothers me is, is, uh -- -"
b,Uh-huh.
t1,"-- not the biggest thing, -"
sv,"but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information, uh, situation,"
b,Yeah.
+,"that you, uh, that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any s-, sort of credit,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"e-, extensive checks and, and things of that nature."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"When, um, -"
sd,"I, I, I mean I, I don't know if that's an invasion of privacy, simply, I, I do t-, I do feel it is"
sd,"but I don't know whether,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,some of the questions they ask are legitimate --
b,"Uh-huh,"
+,"-- uh, because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your <laughter>, -"
sd,"Well what's scary is, uh, uh, about two, three, four months ago on a Sun-, in the Sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here, The DALLAS MORNING NEWS."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"They showed a reporter and a, um, and a copy editor how they went out"
sd,"and they just took, um, a fellow in John Q. Public in Dallas"
sd,"and all they had was, -"
sd,"let's see, they had his birth-, they had something like his birth date, the street address,"
sd,"um, they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name, <cough> excuse me,"
sd,"and it was, um, very scary to see what they found out."
sd,"I mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against, you know, two or three houses, through a two divorces, children's names, locations,"
sd,"um, it was really frightening."
sv,"Well I guess, I guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"that once you give your social security number there are people I guess who are, who are, uh, actually collecting all this all the time"
b,Yeah.
sd,"I understand, uh, -"
sd,"I read the other day that, uh, these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone --"
b,Uh-huh.

b,"Right,"
b,uh-huh.
sv,"I, I, I feel that is an invasion of privacy"
%,"but it, -"
aa,"I do too,"

sd,"I don't, the other thing I don't like is, um, in terms of uh, -"
sd,"like we just moved here from, uh, Minneapolis"

b,Yeah.

sd,"you know, husband and wife, owners, um, who had never done this before."
sd,"They, um, asked us for again an astounding amount of information"
sd,"and what we really didn't have the same opportunity, -"
sv,"you know, and I guess that's when I also get upset that if you're going to do it then I want to do it too."

qo,How about yourself?
sd,"Well, actually I've done both kinds --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- uh, I'm originally from the State of Virginia --"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"There's a possibility, but that was so long ago <laughter> --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- I moved here to, to State College, uh, in nineteen fifty-five --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water --
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"I'm in an area called Center County, which is in the very center of the State of Pennsylvania,"
sd,I've <throat_clearing> I've been in that area

b,"Uh-huh,"
^2,for brookies. -

sd,I haven't fished in several years --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- I'll have to admit, but when I do fish, I do contact, uh, some of the local specialists --"
b,Yeah.

qy,"Do you fly fish, or are those streams too small?"
na,"Uh, no,"
na,"we, we fly fish."
b,Yeah.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"<Throat_clearing> I used to do that a little when I lived up in New York,"

b,Uh-huh.

sd,"Well, our, our streams here are replanted with fish about every year --"
sd,It's all put and take.

sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.

b,Yeah.

sd,"And, uh, and we found that, uh <throat_clearing> you know, it was a very liberal kind of community."
sv,"But the, uh, I, I really feel that, that the law enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars"
sv,"and then they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together"
sv,"and they, uh, they, I think, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process. Uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years."
sv,"Uh, and I, I think that, uh, that there's something that has to be changed in the system to, to do that."
sv,"I think capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough"
sv,but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way.
b,<Music> Uh-huh.
qy,"Do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, <throat_clearing> more, uh, was or, or more, uh, you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?"
sv,"Well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,"
sv,it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself.
sv,"It's at that point where they're saying like here you're, you're going on death row"
^q,but you'll stay there for twenty years.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,And nothing is being done about it.
sv,"Uh, the laws exist and (( )) are frequently upheld in, in, uh, in Appeals Court just because of technicalities <swallowing> and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find."
sv,"And it's, it's really getting out of hand (( )) in many states."
sv,"Well, <throat_clearing> the term technicality (( )) . -"
sv,"The law enforcement community,"
x,<Rustling>.
+,"uh, uh, you know, has to, has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which, uh, grievous <<mispronounced>> acts are done to, uh, to, you know, to get somebody into a, a situation where they're going to be guilty of, of a crime."
x,<Noise>.
sv,"Or whether, uh, an-, and whether the rights of that individual are been, have been, you know, impuned."
sv,"Uh, but <throat_clearing> or whether there's just, you know, a policeman has just made a, uh, <noise> a, you know, a non, a noncritical error, though be it not the right way to do it -"
sv,"but, but, you know, the, the merits of the case in terms of, you know,"
x,<Talking.>
+,"the guy was a law breaker, as being supportive."
h,"Now, I, I'm, a-, a-, at this juncture"
sd,"I, you know, I'm, I'm not sure, you know, what constitutes a, a technicality."
sv,"You know, that, that's what all c-, these, these hearings are about"
sv,"and that's what all these, you know, court cases are about."
sd,"I mean our, uh, our, our glorious, uh, you know, mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of, out of the can"
sd,"and, uh, <throat_clearing> you know, he, he tried to appeal his conviction. Uh,"
sd,"and, you know, it didn't work."
sv,"But be that as it may, everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry."
sd,"Uh, in, in the old days, you know, and say round about times of battle of Hastings, you know, and the (( villages )) if you were a transgressor, they, they either, you know, drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody"
sd,"and he, you were his slave."
sd,"And if he didn't like what you did, he killed you."
x,<Noise>.
sv,"And that has, that's pretty effective."
sv,"Uh, you know, it's not good for civil rights, I guess,"
sv,"but it's pretty effective in that, you know, you've got to get along in the community"
sv,"and if you don't you'll perish. Either by the hand of your, your, your master or by being pushed out in the woods."
sv,"So, I, I, I mean as, as man has gotten more complicated so all of the, uh, imaginations to, uh, you know, protect him from, from being, uh, dumped on by, uh, civilian authority in, in so-, in criminal actions, especially, you know, murder cases and that sort of thing."
sv,"Well, it seems like <cough>, well it, it seems as if in the past typically <talking> there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished,"
sv,"and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system <swallowing> is to protect those who (( actually )) didn't the crimes, albeit it seems that we are failing in that, in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off."
sd,"Um, for instance, um there's a case a few years back where, uh, <swallowing> someone, uh, someone who's being convicted for, was under a tri-, was going to trial for murder, was let off because of a technicality in that. The of-, the arresting officer, uh, did not read the defendant their rights."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And where his,"
x,<Throat_clearing>.
+,"old evidence was there, the witnesses were there, the, everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet <music>, -"
sv,"Well, Wayne, I, uh, feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children, and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available."
qo,How do you feel about it?
aa,"Well, yeah,"
sv,I feel much the same way.
sd,"I've, uh, two kids right now --"
b,Yeah.
sd,-- one is two and a half
sd,"and one's nine months,"
sv,"and, uh, that age, of course, everything you do they're trying to learn to do,"
sv,"and so, uh, it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn, you know, that, that they need to learn at the age, you know --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- reading, and, uh, reading and playing nice with others, and that sort of thing."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"we went through this with our children, and now with our grandchildren,"
sd,"and I've always tried to do things with them, uh, like, when you're at the little league, helping out even though I'm not a good athlete myself,"
sd,"I was able to help the coach in, in just controlling the kids, if nothing else,"
sd,"and we've always, uh, oh tried to take our children and no-, now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to."
sv,"I think that's just part of their overall educational process, is to get out and see and do things."
aa,"Right,"
aa,uh-huh.
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
%,"And so, it's uh, -"
sd,"we have, uh, lived several places around the U S"
sd,"and we have, where we've lived, we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area,"
sd,"like when we lived in Tennessee, we, we took them to Washington, D C to see all the capitol and, and things like that when they were small."
sd,"And it's just, uh, it's helps, I think, the children to, when they're learning in school, to say, well, I've been there and I've seen that."
b,Right.
b,Yeah.
b,Uh-huh.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"So, uh, that's the type, -"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"it certainly does, because, uh, you know, the things in the books seem so dead to the kids, you know, unless they've actually been there or whatever,"
sd,"because I remember our family, well, we, we, we went everywhere."
sd,"And, uh, seeing New England and, uh, being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that was --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- really made the whole thing more, uh, visual."
b,Yes.
sd,"And we could, uh, read the things in the history books and understand what they said, when it was like, we need food, we need to raise food quickly --"
b,Yeah.
+,-- because this place gets very cold very soon.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"we've, uh,"
x,<Cough>.
+,"<Throat_clearing> gone through that, uh,"
sd,"I remember my parents didn't do all those type things,"
sd,and so I made a special effort with my children to do things like that.
sd,"And even now with my grandchildren, I feel it's a very important thing to be done."
aa,"Right,"
sv,"because if, uh, kids don't look up to you, or, or, ca-, can't feel they can spend time with you, they're going to find someone else --"
b,Yeah.
sv,"-- and uh, you know, nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to, emulating or whatever."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Well, I can remember one of the things I'm most proud of is, uh, when my son was, -"
sd,"I think it was in the sixth grade,"
sd,"they had to write a, a little brief autobiography of themselves, and about what they had done and what they wanted to do,"
sd,"and I was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to, uh, have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,A real point of pride with me.
b,"Yeah,"
aa,that is nice.
b,Yeah <cough>
sv,"excuse me, it sounds like we both have colds."
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"well, it's, um, well, it's, uh, ten o'clock here in Falls Church, Virginia."
b,Oh.
sd,So that the only reason I'm home is because I'm home with a cold <laughter>.
%,"Oh, well, we're -"
sd,"And the wife says, Well, you need something to do,"
^q,talk to a guy on the phone.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"well, I'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas, Texas."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"So, we're kind of far apart here."
b,Yeah <cough>.
sd,"This is a very interesting program I, I heard about here on this,"
sd,"and when I signed up for it, it, uh, looked like it could be, make a real contribution in participating."
aa,Right.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,I'm an electrical engineer by trade --
b,Yeah.

sd,"Likewise, we, uh, we do some projects every now and then."

b,Yeah.
sd,I'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan <laughter>.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"So, Trying to work myself out of a job <laughter>."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"But, it's been an interesting, uh, roughly, oh, nine months here,"
sd,"and, uh --"
b,Oh.

sd,"We've lived here about seventeen years,"
%,"and it's, uh, -"
sd,we enjoy living here.
sd,"It's where we originally started out,"
sd,and we've lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee.
sd,"So, wound up back about two hundred miles aware, away from where we started out."
b,Yep <laughter>.
sd,"Well, uh, that's about all I can think to talk about right now."

sd,"the biggest, <noise> uh, way it's going right now, <noise> uh, lot, most of the grocery stores --"
b,Uh-huh.

qy,"# Is it, #"
b,"# uh, #"

sd,It's all voluntary.
sd,"Now, they do have some places where you can take things and get cash"
b,# Right. #
b,Uh-huh.

b,# Yeah. #
+,"# what # we do. You know,"
b,Uh-huh.
%,"we, <breathing> -"
sd,"probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in"
sd,and we let the kids get the money for that.
b,Right.
b,Yeah.
%,"But, uh, -"
sd,"# There's, #"
%,"# f-, # -"

b,Right.

b,Right.
aa,Yeah.
aa,"That's true,"
sd,"but, but that's really the, the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"You know but, -"
%,"I guess, I, -"
sd,"you see, I guess it depends on your landfill space."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"I know, I, -"
sd,"we're in Maryland,"
%,"but, my, -"
sd,I from Pennsylvania *missing copula?
sd,"and my parents how, are forced recycling,"

b,Yeah.
ba,"Oh, wow."
sv,"Uh, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York are some of the, uh, -"
sv,they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones.
b,Yeah.
sv,"So, it's really, uh, it's, uh, really hard on them."
sd,"Now, up here in Maryland, though, we're j-, just in a voluntary recycling stage right now."
sd,"So, uh, so my wife and I, you know, we save our bottles,"
sd,"and we save our newspapers,"
sd,"and we save all our plastic, and all of our tin cans."
sd,"And just like you say, we go to, uh, a community area where they have it set up"
sd,and we dump them off <noise> there.
qy^d,"So, it's vol-, -"
ny,# Yeah.
sd,"It's still voluntary, #"
sd,# you say it is # all voluntary.
qy,"Do they, -"

qy,Will it be mandatory?

b,Uh-huh.
qy,"Is it all, um, -"
qy,is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff
qrr,"or is it all, -"
sd,Mostly just the cans.
bk,Okay.

b,# Yeah.

b,Right.
b,# Yeah. #
aa,# Yeah.
aa,# That's true.

ar,"Well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers,"

b,Yeah.

b,Uh-huh.

b,Yeah.
%,"You know, and they, -"
sd,I mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees
sd,"and, you know --"
b,Right.
+,"-- it's really, -"
sd,<laughter> I can't believe that --
b,Yeah.

sd,"I, um, <lipsmack> I, I work in a, uh, speech interface lab,"

sd,"The state of Maryland has lost, asked all the colleges and universities, and some of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their office paper."
b,Uh-huh.
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"But, you know, in the giant bins around, -"

b,# Right. #

b,Yep.

b,Right.

sd,"I mean, it's just amazing, <noise> you know,"
b,# Yeah.
sv,"So, I think, #"

qy,"you know, I guess a lot of the large organizations, <noise> probably T I, did they advertise on television how successful they are?"

b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# But, # I haven't seen anything."
b,Yeah.

aa,Right.
aa,Yeah.
aa,"That would probably,"
sd,"# You know. So, #"

+,"So, I don't see a lot of advertisements for T I."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Because I know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television,"
sd,"you know, they'll jus-, come up and say, -"
sd,"you know, they'll show you tho-, to encourage <sniffing>, to encourage recycling."
sd,"They'll,"
b,# Right. #

b,Right.

sv,"Well, even, I mean, in the kid's schools,"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"And, I know my kids, um, like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, Oh, look at that. Somebody is not saving the earth, <laughter> you know."
b,Right.
b,Yeah.

b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And, and they're saying, We estimate this landfill be ov-, will be full in two years unless we cut back."

b,Right <laughter>.
aa,# Yeah.
aa,That's true. #
sd,"It's really,"

sd,"I,"
b,# Right. #

b,Yeah.
%,"But, well, -"
+,"so cost, you know, -"
sv,"Well, in some ways, I guess, it, it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, you know. Because,"
+,"# I # know that, like in,"
+,"Pennsylvania, <noise> they require them to, um, <lipsmack> put their newspaper for recycling."
sd,"But, <noise> the de-inking process that they have to, they use,"
b,# Uh-huh. #

b,Uh-huh.

b,# Oh. #
sd,"# and # also, it w-, it produces a, a waste, a, um, a,"
b,Oh.

b,# okay. #
^2,Is not --

b,"# Oh, okay,"
b,"okay. Oh, #"

sd,"I,"

b,Right.

b,# Yeah. #

sd,"So, we're very fortunate --"
b,Huh <<very faintly>>.
+,"-- but <noise> I know in some areas, it's really, it, it really is bad."
sd,"<Lipsmack> Um, I was trying to think, uh, -"
sd,something we were watching the other day -
sd,"and they were doing an overview of Los Angeles, uh, from an area that was up higher"
sd,and you literally could see the band of smog.
%,"That, uh, -"
sd,"I've never been out there,"
sd,"but,"
sd,I haven't either.
+,"<Swallowing> it was, it was quite evident <laughter> that,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,it was a real brown area
%,"and, -"
sv,"Well, I think it would be terrible to live in an area like that"
sv,"and, unfortunately, I think there are a lot of areas that are, that, that bad."
b,Yeah.
sv,"Particularly in the areas where there are industries, uh, where they are burning a lot of coal,"
b,# Yes. #
+,# and oil # --
b,Yeah <<very faint>>.
+,"-- up, more up north, I guess, uh,"
sv,"I think it's a bigger problem. With the car pollution, anti-pollution devices,"
sv,"I think, uh, air isn't as bad it once was, from the cars, because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area."
b,Yes.
sd,"Well, I know, uh, that's been the concern in Europe."
%,"They hadn't, -"
sd,"uh, we have friends in Germany and, uh, <swallowing> have family that live near the Black Forest area"
sd,"and <sigh> large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we, s-, uh, switched to the unleaded gas and, and had the emission control advice, uh, <laughter>, devices required on the cars, uh,"
sd,that's something that Europe didn't do right away
sd,and now they're doing that
sd,"and I guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country, that's the only pollution that's been there."
sd,It's not an area that is industry
sd,"but they were losing a lot of, uh, trees # and a lot of, # -"
qy^d,# From # acid rain?
na,"Um, I guess. From, from something that the car was, uh, # was giving, #"
sd,"# I think # it gives off, uh, in the emissions, it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere, uh, and form a, a weak acid."
b,"# Yes,"
%,"and, # -"
sd,# It # just makes the rain fall on the acid side
sd,"and after a period of time, I think that accumulates in, uh, trees because they take it up through their roots, as well as it landing on the leaves, on surfaces,"
sd,like you've seen what it's done to buildings even --
b,Yes.
+,-- where it's really bad.
b,Yeah.
sd,"<Swallowing> What's interesting, several years ago, I took a course, uh, on, uh, <lipsmack> well, -"
sd,"it was actually, it was put on by the power companies and, about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was,"
sd,"and there wasn't from various kinds of, of energy. -"
sd,"And, uh, at that point in time, one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain"
sd,"and it was kind of pooh-poohed, you know."
sd,"Oh, you're making a mountain out of a molehill, kind of thing."
sd,"And it's turned out that, that's been very true, what he was forecasting about the accumulation of, of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage."
sd,"So, it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course."
sd,"Now, a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear."
sd,"Uh, I'm not afraid of nuclear, having had that course because of how the nuclear that, uh, they use is not bomb quality,"
sd,"and, we're so strict with all our controls in the United States. The chances of, of an accident are slight,"
sd,"and, it doesn't pollute the air at all. <laughter>"
sd,It's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant.
sd,Many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants.
sd,"It's kind of funny because people are just petrified, at least some are, at the thought of nuclear."
b,Yes.
h,"So, I don't know."
sd,In Europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power
sd,and they recycle the fuel
%,"and then instead of, of, -"
sd,"some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become, uh, bomb quality. <sigh>"
sv,"But, that's the only sensible thing to do, is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground. As far as I'm concerned, where it could eventually, perhaps, there's some problem, uh, pollute the groundwater."
h,"So, I don't know what the answer is."
sv,"The best answer, of course, would be solar or, uh, <static> fusion, or something clean <laughter>."
b,Yes.
qy,"Well, we've got a problem on the line, <static> don't we."
ny,Yeah.
sd,"I, I get that sometimes, um,"
sd,my line gets some static.
sd,I don't # know why. #
b,# Uh-huh. #
sv,"But, uh, solar, of course, would be the clean, the cleanest."
%,"Well, I know it's (( )) , um, -"
x,<Static>.
sd,we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston
sv,"and, uh, oddly enough I thought our part of the country was ideal."
sd,I can't hear you at all for all # this static. #
sd,"# Oh. <throat_clearing> # <noise> I don't know what to, <laughter> -"
sd,usually it's the other phone I have trouble with.
sd,"It must just,"
x,<Static>.

qy,Can you hear me?
sd,Now I can again.
b,Okay.
x,<Static>.
sd,"I don't know what, uh, I, I don't know what the problem is"
sd,"but, uh, when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater"
sd,# and # --
+,-- we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for <noise> solar homes and solar energy
sd,"and we have enough clouds that, uh, there are other areas that would be better suited."
sd,"That surprised me because I think,"
+,"we have a tremendous amount of, um, sunny days."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"And, and it, -"
b,"yes,"
sd,it can be used
sd,and it can help
sd,"but, uh, that was a problem that they were still working on."
%,"But, -"
b,Oh yeah.
sv,"It, it's still got a long way to go."
%,"# Well I, # -"
sv,"# It's just, # you know, a possible solution --"
b,Yes.
+,"-- in the future, I think, maybe to help in some ways."
sd,It may not in all ways.
sd,"Maybe they'll come up with fusion. <Lipsmack> You know, con-, be able to control it."
sd,"I don't know how long that'll take,"
sv,"but, <laughter> one of these days, -"
sv,because that's perfectly clean.
b,Yes.
sd,It's just we can't control it.
sd,"Right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out,"
%,"so, it isn't, not at all, -"
sd,"and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field,"
sd,so that's not going to work. At least not now.
sv,"But, uh, <static> who knows what the future will hold. Uh, as far as energy goes,"
sv,"I, I think, <sigh> with solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well."
ba,"Uh, I hope so <laughter>."
sd,I do to.
sd,"<laughter> I like to be optimistic,"
sd,I don't like to be pessimistic <laughter> about these things.
%,"Well, I do think, um, -"
sv,"I mean, you've already mentioned several things, I think, uh, just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in, uh, -"
sv,"We have one earth,"
b,Yes <<very faint>>.
+,to live on
sv,and we got to take care of it.
b,Yes.
sv,"# Well, # --"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"-- and, and for the future generations, too. Uh,"
sd,"I've noticed students are, are much more, you know, young, young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment --"
b,# Yes. #
+,-- # and # protecting the earth.
sv,"And so, if we can raise it, uh, you know, generations with those concerns, we'll solve a lot of our problems."
%,"I'm afraid, -"
sd,"I know I was part of the me generation where they didn't, (( )) so many of them didn't, people didn't care."
%,"You know,"
%,"it's whatever, you know, -"
^q,"recycle, well, if it's a problem, forget that."
^q,"Uh, not throw the trash out the car window"
^q,and leave it in the car and then throw it away?
sv,"How horrible, <laughter> you know."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"Now, I've always done those kinds of things because I just didn't like messes,"
%,and <<voices fade off>> ... -
sv,"So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order"
sd,"and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties <inhaling> from the time that you bought it."
qo,What do you think?
qy,Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there?
ng,"Well, actually, I don't think they're out of line."
h,"De-, Devil's advocate possibly,"
sv,"but <rustling> <inhaling> it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes"
sd,"and whe-, whether or not you agree with that law, i-, you're still circumventing it."
sd,"You are legal in, in your circumvention of that law."
qw,"What, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though?"
qw,"I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order?"
sv,"Really, I, I, I don't think that's a valid argument."
sv,I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax.
sd,"Um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or, or, uh, Bryn Mawr stereo dealer."
qh,"Uh, but th-, th-, th-, then why not pay, pay the sales tax (( ))."
sd,"Corporations have to,"
qh,"why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?"
sv,"Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania."
sd,"It's because, I'm sorry, the Commonwealth of # Pennsylvania. # -"
b,# Yes. #
sv,"Uh, it's because I, I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area."
sd,So I go outside the area for that.
sv,"And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state."
sv,"I don't, I don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer."
aa,"<Lipsmack> I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility"
qh,"but, b-, is it also legal,"
x,<Rustling> <static>.
+,for you to do that?
sd,"W-, w-, fr-, from what I understand from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years."
sd,"It is, it is a lost revenue stream right now"
sv,"and states c-, can use all the revenue they can get."
qy,"With some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply?"
no,"Well, I think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it."
sv,"Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, I bought this out of state."
^q,I need <sigh> to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania.
sd,Which is exactly what businesses do at the present.
aa,Right.
sv,But the point is is that businesses do that.
sd,The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question.
sv,That's a cost of doing business.
sv,The # burden # --
sd,"# And I, I # --"
+,-- shouldn't be placed on the consumer.
+,"-- I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it."
%,Uh.
sd,"That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works."
sd,"Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay."
sd,"But the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay."
sd,"And there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that."
qy,"Uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a # consumer and # --"
%,"# I-, (( )). # -"
+,-- then being responsible for the sales tax?
nn,No.
sd,"Businesses, uh --"
+,Or purchasing.
+,"-- if purchasing things mail order,"
sd,"if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah."
sd,"Um, I, I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax."
sd,"My a-, accounting department will at the end of the month."
sv,"I think that i-, i-, I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania."
sd,"And I know they work that way in, uh, say here in D C."
b,Yeah.
sd,"See I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't, I never see that end of the business."
b,Yeah.
sd,"So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer."
sv,"Uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided."
aa,That's true.
sv,"I-, i-, a r-, a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, I, I forgot that."
sd,"There, there is no well defined mechanism at all"
sv,"and, and that it is a <inhaling> a l-, loss. I, I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju-, just to do just that in or-, in order to gain the revenue that's being lost."
sd,"Uh, I mean, I, I don't know if I agree with that."
%,"But it, but, -"
x,<Rustling> <static>.
fp,Hi.
qw,"So, uh, what was the last car repair you had?"
sd,"<Laughter> Just recently I was kind of laughing when I, when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because, uh, I had to have my, uh, radiator flushed --"
bk,Oh.
sd,-- and it was getting rusty.
sd,"And the thing that they forgot to do was to, um, to also look at the hose,"
sd,"and I had gone about oh, two days with my new radiator flushed"
sd,and the hose burst.
sd,So I was stranded out on the highway <laughter>.
ba,"Oh, no."
qy,Did you crack the block or what?
nn,"No,"
sd,"I, I didn't do that thank goodness,"
sd,"but, uh, there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there, you know, left to do that"
sd,"but it cost me all kind of money, you know, to have that repaired after they said they were going to, they had repaired it."
sd,"So that was, that was a horrible experience --"
bk,"Yeah,"
bk,I see.
+,-- just recently.
sv,You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though.
aa,"Yes,"
aa,yes.

b,Yeah.
%,"Go-, -"
sd,"because I can't, uh, I don't know if I want to, you know, pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown."
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is
sv,and it's not worth it <laughter>.
aa,"Uh-huh,"
aa,uh-huh.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,that's true.
aa,I agree with you there.
b,Yeah.
h,"So I don't know, uh,"
sd,"because I, I need to have it tuned, you know, tuned up and I don't know, replace some of the belts."
sd,"And I was looking at the, uh, -"
sd,tires need to be replaced
sd,and so I was thinking just a lot of money -
%,"I'm, -"
sd,might as well buy me a new car for that.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,I got new tires last winter too
sd,"so I'm like, well, that's the last major purchase for this thing."
^q,It's not worth it.
aa,Uh-huh.
qy^d,"Well, you have to, in Pennsylvania, boy,"
qy,"<noise> you have to really have your car winterized and stuff, huh?"

sd,You just rinse it off after the winter is over and --
b,Uh-huh.

aa,"Yeah,"

b,Yeah.
sd,I usually like to do most repairs on my own though.
bh,Do you?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,just because that way I know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't.

b,uh-huh.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Plus if something goes wrong, I know who to blame."

^2,"# Oh, that helps. #"
+,# for nothing # .
b,Right.
b,Yeah.
sv,"Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their A, their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on."
aa,You're right.
sv,And that's kind of silly.
aa,Yeah right.
aa,Absolutely.
b,Yeah.
sv,"Because they,"
sv,You're defeating the purpose.
+,"they figure that, that's correct <laughter>."
x,<Laughter>.
sv,The idea is to use their money <laughter>.
b,<Laughter> Yeah.
sv,"And, uh, during that whole month and,"
b,Yeah.

aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"I mean, I get, I get at least one or two a week."
b,Uh-huh.

b,Right.

aa,# Yeah.

^q,You've already been preapproved.
aa,"oh, absolutely,"
aa,preapproved.
sv,That's their favorite word.
aa,Yes.
sv,"Everybody in the country is preapproved, I think."
aa,"<Laughter> I think so, you're right."

b,Yeah.

b,Uh-huh.

b,Yeah.

sv,"And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, I didn't realize I had this much,"
^2,That much stuff.
+,"you know, I'd spent this much money."
b,Right.
sv,"And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it."
sv,"Well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"and, I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just co-, costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest,"

qy,are you a native of that part of the country?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,I grew up in New Hampshire.
sd,"It seems, southern town,"

b,Oh.

sd,"I live on one of tho-, that little ten mile spot."
ba,"Uh, sounds wonderful."
qy,Did you have damage this year with hurricanes?
ng,"Not up, um, where I live"
sd,but further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad.
sd,I happened to be in Nassau
sd,and we got the backlash of that thing.
sd,"And they had record high waves, thirty year high waves come in there,"
sd,and it was quite an experience
%,so. -
qw,"Well, what movies are you looking forward to seeing now?"
^h,"Um, well, I'm, I'm only twenty-seven years old"
sd,"so THE DOORS movie, that's out on video. I want to watch that."

qy,# Have you seen GREEN CARD? #
sv,# That would be pretty good. #
nn,"No,"
sd,I haven't seen that one.
sv,That's a real warm movie.

sd,So I would recommend that if you have a chance.
sd,I'm in for it.
sd,We rent a lot of movies

qy,Have you seen that one?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,I did.
bk,Okay.
h,And I don't know

b,"Yeah,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,"And so I took a class,"

qy,<talking> So are you ready?
na,I'm ready.
%,"Okay,"
ad,let's get started. <beep> <<Sounds like a phone beeping in.>>
aa,"All right,"
aa,okay.
%,"Okay,"
qo,"so, uh, what do you think, that, uh, -"
qo,"what do, what do, what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America?"
sv,"Oh, if I knew that I'd be a very wealthy person."
b,"Yeah,"
qo,"but what, what, what are the steps?"
sv,"Well, you have to see,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","I, the way I look at it, you have to think first of all why, *listen"
qh,"or ha-, has crime increased,"
qh,"and if so, why has crime increased?"
sv,"Well, see the problem is, is that, um, <clicking> what happens is as, that you're, uh, you know, as you go from the country to a city, crime always increases, right?"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Because in the country, people still respect, uh, the property of other people."
b,Right.
%,"And so, as, as, -"
sv,and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities,"
sv,and they rush to get the same thing.
sv,"They say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have,"
sv,"and the thing that we can do is, we need money for drugs,"
sv,"and what we have to do is, we have to go, uh, get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it."
bf,"It's easy,"
sv,you said the magic word there.
qw,# Which one? #
sd,# Drugs. #
b,Yeah.
sv,And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased.
sv,"That's, uh, that's, uh, the main reason I think, uh, everywhere"
sv,"because, uh, you have deaths."
sv,"I mean, I mean, you have murders"
sv,"and you have, you know, people stealing other people's stuff,"
%,and that's -
sv,a lot of it has to do with drugs.
aa,"Oh, yes."
%,"It doesn't have to do, -"
sv,"I mean, the thing is is that, you know, it's like you might be standing somewhere, right,"
sv,"and like let's say you, you're, you're, you know, you're driving out"
sv,and you're driving back home
sv,and it's late at night.
sv,"And you stop by one of these, you know, twenty-four hour, you know, gas stations joints."
b,Yeah.
sv,"And, uh, somebody walks in there with a gun."
sv,"I mean, they're going to want the money,"
sv,"and you can tell by the people who are always caught, that these people are there to get money for drugs."
sv,"I mean, they don't want the money so, uh, so they can do something else with it."
aa,"No,"
sv,"they don't want the money for food,"
sv,that's for sure.
aa,"Right,"
aa,"right, #"
%,and so. # -
sv,"# Well, but you know, the, # the strange thing, uh, perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize, is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids,"
sd,"because, uh, I'm a retired educator."
bk,Okay <noise>.
sd,"And, in fifty-one and fifty-two, the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs, how to recognize the pushers --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- outside the one entrance, that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started, and so on, and so on."
sv,"So it's a problem that's been around for over forty years,"
sv,"and we're just really, uh, uh, now, trying to, uh, figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"there's a, there's a, uh, a song that I know which says, you know, tha-, -"
sd,"it's like, in, uh, nineteen eighty-eight, nineteen eighty-nine, the local, state, and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America,"
sv,"and, uh, their figures, I think are too, so -"
sv,"I mean it's like, compared to, you know, compared to, weapons or stuff like that, I mean, you're spending nothing on, on crime in the country itself."
%,"What you're doing is, you, you know, -"
sv,"it's like, you have other things, you know,"
sv,you have the AIDS
sv,"we're going to solve, try to solve --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- the AIDS problem while, while, you know, some people are getting killed here and there"
%,and then <noise>. -
b,Yeah
sv,"and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers, the big dealers in drugs,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"may be, may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction."
sv,But those people never get caught.
%,The people that --
aa,"That's right,"
sv,they'll never get caught.
+,"-- that, that I, -"
sv,"see, their theory is that if I'm surrounded, and I'm going to be caught, I'm going to try to find my way through,"
sv,and they're not going to take me alive.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But I have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me."
aa,That's right.
%,"But they'll, -"
sv,"You know, it's like, -"
sv,"of course, I mean I might be, you know, the the leading drug dealer here,"
sv,"but you won't find me dealing in drugs,"
sv,"I mean, there's no connection --"
aa,That's right.
+,"-- between me and the people that were caught, you know."
aa,"That's right,"
%,"and, they, -"
sv,one person doesn't know the other person down the line.
aa,Right.
sv,"But the guy at the very top, the one who's, who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure, uh, the, uh, and had the political --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- uh, pull to keep things from, uh, keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction, other than on the drug dealing,"
sv,because it sure is monstrous in this country.

b,Huh.

qw^d,"I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was."
sd,I think it's a hundred years.
b,Huh.

qw,Why?

sd,"I, uh, was reading in, uh, a book. Uh, trying to think, -"
sd,"I can't quite remember the name of the book,"
sd,"but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style."
sd,"And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,"
sd,"every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell."
b,Oh.
sd,<Laughter> And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship <laughter>.
b,"Right,"

sv,"well, just because I'm, I'm thinking that it, it's getting so short on radio."
sd,"You still, you have two or three, -"
sd,"I know in Dallas you can probably get two, two all news radio stations out of I don't how many popular radio stations."
sd,"And then on television, you have just the news at six and ten."
b,"Yeah,"
%,"I just, -"
sv,"And I just, I just see that dwindling in, in, -"
sv,"I find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, I mean, just given the way society is."
sd,"And I enjoy reading,"
sv,but most --
aa,"True,"
aa,yeah.

aa,# True.
aa,"That's true, too,"
aa,yeah. #
+,"# flip through the channels, you # know, and get the headline news at thirty minutes of,"
^2,Than sit down and take the effort to read --
aa,Right.
+,-- the paper.
sv,"And they don't have to go get one, you know."
sv,"One thing I like about the paper, um, as opposed <noise> <<piano in background>> to television is that, uh, when I, like when I report, because I'm in television, I have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it."
sv,That's all you have time for.
b,Right.
b,Right.
sv,"Whereas in the paper, I like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side,"
b,Right.
sd,"Well, that's why I like, uh, national public radio --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- because they get on one of these little things,"
sd,"they give you headlines that are brief,"
%,"just, -"
sd,they touch on what's going on.
sd,And then they'll get into something and really explore it.
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sv,"And it's, it's informative."
sv,"It's a lot more informative than, you know, quick, half hour news shows that --"
b,Yeah.
+,-- they tell you what they want you to hear.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,because that's what we do.
sd,"I mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know."
b,Right.
sd,So it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time.
sv,"So, and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by I think."
h,I don't know.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,there's so much going on in the world.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Communication, you know, expands the world now."
b,"Oh, yeah."
sv,There's too much going on.
sv,You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there.
sv,"I think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news,"
sd,"and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, you know."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it."
qh,"And the question is, how much of it or how, some of it, -"
sv,"I guess, there's a lot of debate about censorship and --"
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
+,-- and what we're really seeing.
b,Uh-huh.
qh,"Is it, is it the true story"
qrr,or is it a --
b,Yeah.
+,-- little bit biased.
sv,"Because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they --"
b,Right.
+,-- could tell us.
qh,"So all we had to sit here and, and ask is well, what aren't they telling us, you know."
sd,"So that, that was pretty scary."
%,"But we, -"
sd,"I talked to one woman,"
sd,"and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia, she wouldn't want to know, you know, that they're bombing or, or this and that's going on."
sd,"And at the same time, I talked to another woman,"
sd,and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam.
sd,And she didn't know what was happening at that time.
b,Right.
sd,"And she was so happy to get the information, you know."
sd,So there's just a lot of different opinions on that.
%,"But, -"
sd,"I, I, you know, I like to, to know what's going on."
sv,Sometimes I think there's just a little bit too much.
b,Yeah.
sv,"You know you get in the habit of, like I say, turn on Headline News"
sd,"and it will play over and over <laughter>,"
x,<Laughter>.
sv,and you just tune it out because it's the same thing
%,"but, -"
sv,"And then, too, a lot of times I think, uh, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"they tend to,"
%,"# Like, # -"

sd,"You know, like this Kennedy thing."
b,Yeah.
sv,"<Clicking> <<sounds like a keyboard>> It's just, I mean, everywhere you turn."

b,Uh-huh.

sd,"So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,"
sd,"but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us."

b,Uh-huh.

b,Yeah.

ba,"Oh, that's pretty good."
aa,Yeah.
sd,"Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site <clicking> --"
b,Uh-huh.

arp_nd,"Well, it's got a, a very small furnace."
b,Uh-huh.

b,Yeah.
sd,"But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, lo-, these many months --"
b,Uh-huh.

qy,Is it a single story?
arp_nd,"Well, not really."
sd,"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill."
bk,"Oh, I see."

%,"the, the, the, -"
sd,what I call residential level --
b,Uh-huh.

bk,"Um, I see."
sd,"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high."
bk,Oh.
sv,So I've got a pretty good grade there.
b,Yeah.
sd,"And then when I put the verandas whi-, which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- that will define the shop.
b,"<Noise> Yeah,"
qy,"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?"
na,Exactly.
b,Yeah.
sd,"I, I've always liked that."
%,"The, -"
sd,"you know, I, we don't have much yard"
sd,but I built a small deck in the back.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck."
qo,So. How's your products been?
sd,"Um, I really haven't had, uh, too many problems."
sd,"Uh, seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out."
ba,<Laughter> I hear that one.
qy,Have you had any lately go out?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,"
%,"and they, -"
sd,"unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new house,"
sd,"and, uh, I really don't have any recourse,"
sd,so I had to call and have them all repaired and that.
ba,"Oh, wow."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,it was a hassle.
qy^d,"So you didn't get anything,"
qy,"even, all the, all the warranties were out?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"the warranty on the refrigerator, uh, -"
%,"the i-, -"
sd,"the refrigerator warranty's still good,"
sd,"but the ice maker itself, passed its three years,"
sd,and it was three years and two months.
ba,<Laughter> You're kidding.
nn,No.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"we just moved into a new house, too,"
sd,"so we had to buy all those, too."
ad,"Uh, watch out."
aa,"<Laughter> Yeah,"
sd,"the only thing I've had problems with is, um, -"
sd,I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise <throat_clearing> that it's nontoxic and such,"
sd,and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings.
%,So. -
%,Um.
sd,"I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than, -"
sd,I just ended up using it.
sd,"But, that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong."
%,But. -
sd,"I usually have pretty good luck with appliances,"
%,"but I just, uh, -"
sd,"it was within two days that all three of these stopped working,"
sd,and the --
ba,That's incredible.
+,"-- the ice maker was, uh, had to have a new pump,"
sd,"and the, uh, microwave had to have, uh, some kind of something I can't even pronounce,"
x,<Laughter>.
%,"and they, uh, -"
sd,"the dryer had to have a new heating element,"
sd,"so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them."
qy^d,And they all went out at the same time?
na,"Uh, within # two days of each other. #"
b^m,# Or two days.
ba,# Wow.
%,"I was, -"
sd,it wasn't a good week.
sd,I was pretty mad.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business,"
sd,"so even if I, I think even if I had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured,"
sd,"but still they were through that retailer,"
sd,so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not.
ba,"Wow,"
sd,it's frustrating.
sd,"But I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- who came out and fixed them all,"
%,"but, I, -"
sd,"the only other things that I've ever had trouble with, uh, -"
sd,"I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers, blow dryers."
b,"Uh-huh,"
qy^d,they go out a lot?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,I've had two or three of those go out.
sd,"One was under warranty,"
sd,"and the other two weren't,"
%,"but, I just, -"
sd,"other than that, you know, T V -s and things like that, I haven't ever had any trouble with."
sv,I don't think products are getting much better though.
aa,Yeah.
sd,See I'm in the manufacturing (( )) -
sd,home from work -
sd,"and make, um, automotive air bags, the safety air bags. -"
bh,"Oh, really?"
ny,Yeah.
ba,That's interesting.
sd,"At Morton International, -"
%,"and, I thin-, -"
sd,"well, it's, it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment."
sd,"We test everything after each assembly process,"
sd,"and so our testing is pretty thorough,"
%,but. -
qy,"Do you, do you test each individual one --"
%,Um.
qrr,"-- or do you just test, -"
qy^d,"like if you've got ten, you test one,"
qy^d,and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay?
no,"Um, the tests that, -"
na,"well, we test every one electrically."
%,"We don't, -"
sd,"I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,"
sd,"so, each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done,"
sd,"and then we do electrical tests on them during the process,"
%,so. -
sd,"Well, that's something I've never had to use,"
sd,"it's never, I've never been involved in an automobile accident,"
sd,"so, luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test."
b,<Laughter> Yeah.
sd,But I think it's a great idea.
%,"I'm, I'm, -"
sd,seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about
%,but that. -
sd,"Well, they do the, all the testing that we have to do through the government,"
sd,it's incredible how much testing they have to do.
sv,"Oh, I'm sure they want to be thorough before they. -"
%,"But, uh, even, -"
sd,"you know, I don't mind spending the extra money on the car --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- if, you know, even if they pass the savings, the cost onto the consumer, because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing."
sd,"I'm not a real big seat belt, -"

qy,"Are you a Vietnam veteran, Dudley? <Music>."

b,Yeah.
sd,"Then, uh, another friend of mine went,"

b,Yeah.

sv,"But,"
b,Uh-huh.

sv,"Well, you know, one of the most troublesome things that I have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country --"

b,Yeah.

x,<Throat_clearing>.

b,Yeah.

sv,There is a culture change there.

sv,"And, uh, tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them, which is not bad."
b,No.
sv,Not really.
sv,"Uh, but it might in the long run you can see where scholarships, for example,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"uh, even jobs. Uh, jobs that would normally go to an American, with a lesser education, might be going to, to some of these people here."
sv,"And that is all a result of, of, of Vietnam."

x,<Throat_clearing>.

b,Yeah.

b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he, where he had made those moats."
qw,What world war do you think they found the experience for that?

qy,Don't you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam?
%,"W-, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,partially.
sv,"Part of it is that,"
b,Uh-huh.

sv,"and you say, ""Never more."""
b,Yeah.
sv,"And, and you overcome those problems,"
sv,and you are prepared next time.
sv,"I think that is one of the reasons that they have, they have pretty much avoided getting involved in South America."
sv,Because --
b,Uh-huh.

sv,"and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him,"
b,Right.

b,Uh-huh.
sv,He probably just went right down into a tunnel.
b,Sure.
b,Sure.
b,Sure.
sv,"Well, I know that, <sigh> uh, from a personal standpoint, people was one of the finest assets that we lost."
sv,We did not actually physically lose them.

sv,but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had.
b,Yeah.
ba,That is right.
sv,"Uh, being entirely different people."
sv,I had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had.

b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.
sv,"and that has to affect you if you are human, you know."
ba,"Oh, yeah,"
b,yeah.
sv,So they had to --

sv,"I do not,"

b,Yeah.

b,Right.
sd,And I cannot blame them.
sd,I do not know a solution.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,But I sure cannot blame them for being angry.

%,"Uh,"
b,Right.
sd,"For the most part, I wish that it had not happened."
b,Yeah.
sd,But it did.
sv,"And that,"

sd,"And, and, and they f-, initially got into it because of Eisenhower."
sv,"And he just, he did not want to be in it any more than, than what we started out in August with Desert Storm."
ba,"Oh, yeah."
sv,And then it just blew up into the war.
sv,"Well, it has been that way for a very, very long time, though."
sd,"I can remember when I was in the sixth grade,"

b,Uh-huh.
sd,We were reading about the French --
b,"French, yeah."

b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh
x,<barking>.
h,"I really, I do not know,"
sv,"i-, we should not have maybe gotten involved."
sv,"But if we did, we certainly should have supported our people who were there."
b,Yeah.
sv,More so supported them when they got home.
b,Right.
sv,"And, uh, I am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part."
ba,Exactly.
sd,"And I, I saw the movie,"
x,<Cough> <throat_clearing>.

"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Okay,"
sv,"for as far as, um, I would think the, probably the, uh, worst substance that's probably, um, -"
%,"or, started to say the, uh, -"
sv,what causes the most air pollution is probably the car --
ba,"Probably so,"
sv,"-- and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh, train <laughter> or, or something like that"
%,"or, -"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.
aa,"Yeah,"
ba,"that's exactly it,"
sd,"and that's what we're finding, um, here, where we're at, in Minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- that there are inconveniences to that,"
sv,"or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing,"
sv,"so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool."
aa,I think so too.
sd,I'm in Texas --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and very few people carpool --
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- uh, the people that I know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job --"
aa,Exactly.
sd,"-- they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know,"
b,"Uh-huh,"
+,they just feel they need their car.
^2,or if somebody gets sick.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- then they're, they're stuck,"
sv,you're --
ba,That's right.
+,"-- definitely right,"
sv,And people don't want to give it up --
sv,-- but now I think we've made great strides --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and <noise> <<telephone click>> --
b,Sure.
+,-- and to change the car itself --
aa,"Sure,"
sd,"that happens quite a bit,"
sv,"-- but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent --"
b,"Yes,"
b,yeah --
%,-- but --
ba,-- that's very true.
sd,"Uh, other than that, uh, I don't know,"
sd,"Well, my other line is ringing --"
b,Okay.
ad,-- but we're going to ignore it <laughter>.
aa,"Oh, okay, <laughter>"
ad,we'll try to be real quick here.
fa,"I'm sorry for these beeps,"
qw,"The other thing then is, because I don't know how long they want us to talk,"
sd,"Oh, close to five minutes, I believe."
b^m,"Five minutes, oh, okay."
qy^d,"And you're in Minneapolis,"
na,"Minneapolis area,"
qy,"Well, is the pollution really bad up there?"
ng,"Uh, actually no."
sd,"We have, uh, quite a bit, uh,"
sv,the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- and of course hay fever season --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- you get some pollutants such as those,"
sv,but those are natural --
b,Yeah
x,<sniffing>.
%,"-- um, but there is starting to, -"
sd,"in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution,"
sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- you have to have your car inspected --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- or other pollutants,"
sd,"and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,"
sd,Well --
%,at least where you (( )) . -
+,-- that's the way it has gotten here.
sd,"We have just had that law, I think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas --"
b,"Sure,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"-- but, uh, I think it's a good idea --"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,it's not a bad idea.
+,-- because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- which you can't blame them for that --
b,"Sure,"
b,"sure,"
sv,"-- and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed --"
aa,"Exactly,"
sd,"-- and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C -s --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air --
b,Sure.
+,-- they're having to change the type of products they use --
b,Uh-huh.
%,"-- uh, they can't use, -"
sd,"like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning syst-, systems --"
b,Sure.
sd,"-- therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed --"
b,Sure.
sd,"-- and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C -s into the atmosphere --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- it doesn't cost as much --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,"
b,Sure --
%,"But, -"
sv,"-- uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- over there it's a necessity --
b,Right.
+,-- versus something up here we can live without it
sv,but it's uncomfortable --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done,"
sd,and one of the cans <laughter> released entire amount --
%,Um.
+,"-- of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,"
sd,"and, I don't know --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,"
sd,and I was thinking how many other people -- -
sv,"It's probably happened to millions of people,"
ba,"-- oh, sure,"
sv,because --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- if you take it into a service station,"
x,<Sniffing>.
+,"they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, Hey, that's --"
b,Uh-huh
+,-- that's right there.
sd,"I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can --"
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car,"
sd,"and I, I thought about that,"
sd,and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it <laughter> --
^2,"Inhaled so much of it,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,"-- but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that"
b,"Yeah,"
%,"well, of course in the, uh, -"
sv,"I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays --"
+,-- we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here --
aa,Exactly.

"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
qy,"Well, are you a fisher person, are you?"
ny,"Yes,"
sd,I love to fish.
ba,Great.
qw,What kind of fishing do you do?
sd,"Well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes."
qy,In California?
ny,"And, yes,"
sd,and from the banks.
sd,I don't like to go out on boats.
b,Oh.

b,Uh-huh.
b,Oh.

sd,I think I had rather have a catfish than I would a trout <laughter>.
sd,"Well, <laughter> I, I don't blame you."
sd,"I grew up in Nebraska and, uh, grew up fish, cat fishing in the Little Blue River"
sd,"and then, uh, we moved to, uh, South Dakota --"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"and, uh, now that we are down here, I think a lot of people do some, uh, bass fishing and strip bass fishing"

ny,Yep.
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,they do.

b,Oh.
sd,"And, uh, you know, we use to catch those little bullheads"

sd,they look just like baby catfish.
b,Yeah.
qy,"You know, uh, did you get to go fishing very often?"
ny,Oh yeah.
sd,I like to fish.
sd,The only problem is I just moved to Texas
sd,so it's been a little over a year now
sd,"but, uh --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- I, I am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here"
sd,"and I, so really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and it's driving me crazy
sd,"but, uh, one of these days, I will go over to, uh, Lake Lewisville or, uh, <inhaling> what is it, uh Ray Hubbard, Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while <laughter>."
b,Uh-huh.
x,<Laughter>.
qy,"Well, uh, you like to eat them after you catch them?"
x,<laughter>.
ny,"Well, yeah,"
sd,sure.
sv,"Because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,"
%,"# Well mo-, # -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"Most of the time, uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it."
aa,"Uh, and you're right."
sd,I mean I like to fish for trout
sd,"and they are really, uh, uh, good fighters"
sd,"but, uh, if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu."
b,"Yeah,"
ba,I know.
b,Yeah.
qy,"<Laughter> Well, uh, so, do you just, uh, uh, skin your catfish"
qrr,"or do you fillet them out,"

sd,"# We, uh, # skin them."
^g,Do you?
ny,Yeah.
bk,Okay.
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
sd,Just cut their heads off and skin them
sd,"and then I just, uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them."
b,Yeah.
sd,I don't put that corn meal on them.
nn,No.
sd,"You know, uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them"
%,"so <laughter>, -"
sd,"Well, that's how we do it too."
sd,"Uh, although we, uh, use to set some, uh, trout lines out"
sd,"and we've caught, you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish"
sd,"and sometimes those are good to, uh, do on a barbecue grill --"
b,Uh-huh.
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and just leave the skin on and, uh, do it with, uh, butter on, uh, on, on tin foil --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and then the skin just basically scrapes right off
%,"and, uh, wer-, -"
sd,and it really tastes pretty good.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Well you know, I don't think I've ever tried cooking those, uh, catfish quite that big."
%,"There, uh, -"
sd,"Uh, most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones."
b,Yeah.
%,"So, uh, -"
sd,"Well, I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, uh, a rod and reel"
sd,"but, uh --"
b,Um.
+,"-- so far it's just been on, uh, on the trout lines"
%,"so, -"
qy,<Laughter> Wouldn't that be something?
x,<laughter>.
ny,Yeah.
ny,Yeah.
sd,"And, uh, well up in, uh, South Dakota on the, in the Missouri River there we've, uh, tied into a few northern pike"
%,"and, uh, they really, uh, -"
%,"in, in, -"
sd,"when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,"
sd,"but in the summer time, they'll, uh, give you a run for your money."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So when you were, -"
qw,when you did go fishing where did you go?
qw,You moved there from where?
^g,Nebraska?
ny,Uh-huh.
ny,Yeah.
qy^d,"So, it was just like the rivers and, uh, the --"
qy,"In,"
+,"-- lakes I suppose, huh?"
+,In Nebraska?
ny,Yeah.
ny,"Uh, yeah."
sd,"Most of the time, uh, we just fished, uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in."
b,Uh-huh.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And a lot of them ended up being close to the river,"
sd,"so if the river every, uh, flooded, you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and so we would do a lot of fishing there too
sd,"but, uh, South Dakota didn't really have much for, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
b^m,"Okay,"
qw,where have you all been on vacation recently?

br,Detroit?
ny,Yeah.
qy,Is that a nice vacation spot?
ng,"Well, it wasn't really."
sd,"It was, um, uh, to see an old relative."
bk,"Right,"
bk,okay.
sd,"And it was, uh, just to, uh, <lipsmack> have some fellowship with her."
b,Right.
qy^d,So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
nn,No.
sd,"The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico."
ba,"Ooh, that would be nice."
sv,"And that was real nice. Uh,"
qy,Did you scuba dive there?
nn,"No,"
sd,we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.
ba,"Ooh, that would be nice."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit,"
ba,"Oh, that would be enjoyable."
+,from our daily routine.
b,"Right,"
b,"yeah,"
ba,"that's,"
b,Huh.
+,a nice break.
sd,I haven't been on vacation in a while either.
sd,"Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area."
b,Uh-huh.
+,Which is up kind of near Denver.
b,Yes.
+,"And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing."
ba,"Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from."
sd,So it's a lot of fun.
sd,"I worked up there last summer,"
sd,"so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the,"
ba,"Oh, well, that's nice."
+,whole summer long <laughter>.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Worked at a camp there,"
sd,and so I got to <breathing> spend a lot of time up in the mountains.
sd,So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.
sd,"Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,"
sd,and that's canoeing.
b,Oh.
sd,"And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River,"
sd,"and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado,"
sd,and they've really enjoyed it.
ba,That's nice.
sd,"We, um,"
sd,"It's a whole new, -"

b,Uh-huh.
sd,And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.
%,Huh.
sv,"It's really, really pretty."
sd,"I was a little kid then,"
%,"and we <breathing> to have, uh, -"
sd,we stayed at some park
sd,"and they had <breathing> a little <breathing> uh, mountain man who came down the river every night,"
sd,and he would give a little talk about <laughter> mountain things.
sd,"You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man,"
sd,"but we were pretty convinced he was a full,"
b,Sure.
+,"hermit who lived up in,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,"
sd,"and we would have to, we'd (( )) -"
sd,and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found
sv,"and,"
ba,"Oh, that's neat."
+,"That's a good family place to go,"
b,Sure.
sv,"and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,"
sv,"but it wasn't,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"you know, too easy either."
sv,"It was like, -"
sv,"Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too,"
sv,"and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,"
aa,That's true.
sv,"and I think they really <lipsmack> it really pen-, penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it."
b,Uh-huh.
+,"Because it's something you weren't forced to do <laughter>,"
b,Right.
sv,so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.
b,Yeah.
sv,And you're more receptive.
ba,"Well, that's good."
^h,"Well, we, um, let's see, -"
sd,"the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And then I went to England --
ba,"Oh, that's exciting."
+,-- a few years ago.
sd,"I was a,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place"
sd,"and it's, there's not a language barrier"
%,"so you don't, -"
sd,"I mean, there <laughter> there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't <breathing> exactly know what they mean,"
sv,"and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,"
sv,"but <breathing> it's, it was really fun."
sd,"I, I, I really enjoyed that."
sd,"I'm probably going back there to work,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,for a year.
sd,"Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now,"
sd,"but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England,"

sd,"because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it. -"
sv,"It, it's really nice."
sd,"I would, I would spend all my time in London,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"or most of my time,"
sd,"and that's <breathing> it was really different being in a big city,"
sd,"because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot --"
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,"-- and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are"
sd,"and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate,"

^2,Do your own thing.

b,Oh.
sv,"So that was, that, that's a nice place."
sv,Canada is very nice.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,that would be nice.
sd,I had a friend from there.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia,"
sd,but I'd have to have a <laughter> tour guide with me to --
aa,"Oh, yes,"
aa,absolutely.
+,-- help with all the language and all that.
b,"Sure,"
bf,somebody that knows their way around.
aa,"So, yeah,"
sd,"that's why, that's why England was nice."
sd,"Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week,"
sd,"and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, -"
sd,"most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and, -"
qy^d,"Well, you've been quite a few places there <laughter>."
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,we have. <laughter>
sd,We (( )) .
ba,"<Laughter> Once you think about it, huh."

b,Uh-huh.

sd,"It was <laughter> just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day,"
sd,and you slept on the train at night.
ba,"Oh, that's great."
%,"But there wasn't a, -"
sv,"it was strange,"
sv,"it was kind of sad,"
sd,"there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English"
sd,"and everyone in Switzerland,"
b,Uh-huh.

ba,That's great.
sd,So <laughter> we were kind of pitiful.
sd,"We found one restaurant we were in <breathing> and got seated,"
sd,"and then no one knew English in there,"
sd,"and we were just <laughter>,"
b,Uh-huh <laughter>.

qw,What did you wind up with? <laughter>.
sd,"Oh, I had fondue."

b,"Uh, uh-huh."

b,Uh-huh.

sd,"I'd, I'd love to go back there."
sd,There's just not time <laughter>.
sv,"There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything."

b,Right.

b,Yeah.
sv,I guess that's what retirement is all about.

fc,Bye-bye.
qy,Do you see anything wrong with public school systems?
ny,"Well, yes,"
sd,I do.
sd,"Um, I think I'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to, to deal with in some quality way."
sv,I think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job.
aa,I agree.
qy,Do you?
qy,Do you have children in the public school system?
ny,"Yes,"
sd,and I taught for fourteen years --
b,Is that right.
+,"-- before we moved to Texas,"
sd,"and the, the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much"
sd,"I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students,"
sd,and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms --
bf,You were a bookkeeper <laughter>.
+,-- for all the children --
b,Oh.
sd,"-- everything had to be documented,"
sd,"and I had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids,"
sd,it was filled with documentation --
ba,"Oh, no."
aa,-- yes.
sd,"Well, um, I'm, I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back,"
sd,"and, and I'm just really in a dilemma if that's what, you know, -"
sd,I love to work with children and --
sd,"Me, too."
+,"-- to teach them,"
sd,"but I'm really having questions if, if I can deal with that system and, and have a good conscience about, you know, what I do."
sv,"I don't think, I don't think it's the teachers,"
sv,I think it's the system --
aa,I think so too.
%,"-- but, um. -"
sv,They're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now --
b,Right.
+,"-- and teacher competency, you know,"
sv,"and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best,"
sv,she's always worried who's looking over her shoulder
%,"and, -"
sv,What child's going to say something --
aa,That's right.
+,-- some parent's going to overreact to --
aa,I know.
aa,"-- that's, that's true."
sv,"Well, it's, it's hard on the children too,"
sv,"I think, you know, because the, um, the teachers are overworked"
sv,and just like a mommy that's overworked --
aa,That's right.
+,"-- you're not at your best, you know, um."
qy,Do you have children in the system?
na,"I have two,"
na,"I have, in the system -"
sd,one is in ninth grade
sd,"and one is in seventh grade,"
%,"and them, -"
sd,"um, I'm home schooling my kindergartner this year."
bk,Oh.
sd,"We, um, live in a district that has open classrooms,"
sd,and I wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her.
b,Yep.
qy,Are you in Plano?
ny,Yes.
b,"Yep,"
sd,I am too.
b,You too.
sd,And I have one in ninth grade at Clark
sd,"and one at Hendrick this year,"
sd,"and he, my nin-, my, uh, sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews,"
sd,"and the very first year I taught back in seventy-three, we had open classroom"
sd,and it didn't work then --
b,Oh.
sd,"-- and when we moved down here, I was just appalled that they were still doing --"
b,Still at it.
+,"-- it here,"
sd,"Well the explanation <noise> I was, was given about, you know, -"
sd,"they, they seemed to admit that it wasn't working,"
sd,"but they didn't have the money to restructure,"
sv,"but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with, I mean, some kind of partitions --"
b,Partitions --
+,"-- you know,"
sv,-- or just to face the children different directions or to do something --
%,"Just, -"
%,yeah.
sd,-- I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school --
ba,"Oh, goodness."
sd,-- so he spent all day --
b,Oh.
+,"-- in this one large open area,"
sd,"so, I didn't really care for that."
sd,It seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here.
bh,Were they?
sd,"That was our last tour, in Michigan."
sd,"Well, we were from North, um, Carolina,"
sd,"and of course North, North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education."
sd,I think they rank about forty-ninth --
b,Oh.
sd,-- but our children got a very good education there --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- they were in the magnet school program,"
sd,"and a lot of their classes, from the time they were about third grade, they, they changed classes several times during the day, which has its pros and cons,"
sd,but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes --
ba,"Oh, wow."
sd,-- and it was wonderful --
aa,Yes.
sd,"-- so, you know, I'm coming to, to Plano thinking, Well, gosh, it's going to be really great,"
sd,it's ranked so much better <laughter>.
aa,"Yes,"
aa,that's right.
sd,We heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system.
ba,"Isn't that interesting,"
sv,"I, I, I don't understand how they get this, this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money,"
h,I don't know.
aa,"Probably so, on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are --"
aa,I guess so.
%,-- so. -
sd,"Well, my son is at Clark this year too,"
%,"so, uh, we're -"
qy,As a freshman?
ny,Yeah.
b,Yep.
sd,"And, uh, <noise> he's pleased with his classes."
sd,"I, I, I don't guess I've been in <noise> the high school long enough <noise> to, to know what to expect really --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, how to judge it."
sd,"My daughter seems to be having a good time,"
sd,"she was absent with strep throat the last three days,"
sd,"and I ran over and picked up her report card,"
sd,"and she did very good,"
sd,so --
ba,"Well, that's good."
+,-- and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect --
b,Yeah.
+,-- for a freshman to have.
sd,"She's not bogged down,"
sd,but yet she has some every night.
sd,"Well, Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any,"
ba,"so, that's interesting,"
sd,"but, he, his grades, I haven't seen them yet,"
sd,"but supposedly they're good,"
%,"so, -"
b,"Yes,"
sv,you always hear how good.
sd,"Now my son's at,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful
qh,"but,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,who knows what he's going to bring home.
aa,That's right.
qo,"So, how do you feel about capital punishment?"
sd,"Well, I, I'm not really certain how I, uh, I'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good. I mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, uh, uh, uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment --"
b,"Right,"
%,"# you don't think, # -"
+,-- # penalties. #
h,"Yet, on the other hand, uh, I don't know,"
%,"I mean, there is things that <laughter> -"
sv,"seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do."
sv,"Now, you know, I mean somebody, a s-, s-, serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard,"
%,"you kind of, -"
h,I don't know.
qo,What about yourself?
sd,"I, uh, I have the same dilemma, I think. Uh,"
sv,"it's, you know, it seems right sometimes"
sv,"and then other times, you don't know."
b,Uh-huh.
b,"Uh,"
%,"I mean, people, like, -"
%,"I, -"
%,"it's been, -"
sv,"I mean, like the Arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having <throat_clearing> e-, effective, effective punishments"
sv,"and, and they're extremely severe."
sv,"Uh, I, you know, I think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because y-, you never know if it's going to be a-, applied. Right,"
sv,"un-, unlike, uh, like in, in Arab societies. If you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand"
sv,and --
b,# Right. #
+,-- # and you walk around # the rest of your life with one hand
sv,"and everybody knows exactly what, what for."
b,# Right. #
sv,"# Uh, # and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact, -"
sv,"or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off."
aa,Uh-huh.
sv,"And also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,"
sv,"I mean, sure, their life is taken,"
sv,"but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,"
sv,so --
+,-- I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with
sv,so it's more of the easy way out than --
%,"some people, -"
+,"-- making them pay for the con-, for the --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, what they've done."
sv,"Except that, I mean, the, the average cost <throat_clearing> to si-, <lipsmack> to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. I mean, something, I, I was amazed at. Uh, uh, per year,"
sd,it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year.
b,Yeah.
+,To keep people in jail.
sv,"Uh, you know, and it's sort of a <laughter>, sort of a crass perspective <laughter> --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- on the usage of capital punishment,"
sd,"but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh ..."
aa,"Right,"
sd,"but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway,"
%,so --
b,Uh-huh <<faint>>.
+,"-- uh, it's, -"
%,"it doesn't, -"
%,"it seems by, that by, -"
h,"I don't know,"
%,"doesn't ever really, p-, uh ... -"
aa,"Oh, I know,"
%,"I mean, you can't, -"
sv,"it doesn't,"
b,# Yeah. #

aa,# Right.

qw,"So, uh, uh, what are the laws like in Texas?"
%,"It's, Texas is, has, is one of the, one of the s-, well, -"
sd,"I guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment."
sd,"Uh, Texas has had it for a while."
sd,"It's one of the quickest,"
%,"it, it, -"
sd,"once it was, it was reallowed, -"
sd,"I think it was outlawed for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, I mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution"
sd,and it seems like everybody stopped
sd,"and then, and then once they sort of reallowed it, Texas was one of the first to, uh, to actually, uh, implement it again."
bh,"Oh, really?"
sd,"They do it by, uh, by, do it by lethal injection."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, I'm originally from Kansas"
sd,"and in Kansas also, uh, they, they almost immediately put back capital punishment"
sd,"and, uh, there they do it by hanging."
ba,Wow.

b,Yeah.
sd,That way.
qy,And they do it that way?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"well, they, they show it,"
%,"not, not, -"
sd,"I mean, the, the movie was made in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that --"
b,Huh.
sd,"-- and so it's, uh, it's not particularly graphic,"
sd,"but on the other hand it's, it's fairly impressive to watch them, you know, walk into the room with gallows."
sd,It's kind of a barn like structure.
ba,Wow.
sd,"I think they're there,"
sd,"I think that capital punishment is, is, uh, in t-, in Utah also."
sd,I'm not really familiar.
bh,Is that right?
qy,Are you there in school?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,# I am. #
b,# Yeah. #
%,"So, but I think they d-, -"
sd,"a long time ago, I, I remember my dad was telling me this, I think, that, uh, they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns"
sd,and one of them has the real gun in it.
b,"# Uh-huh,"

sd,"# So they don't know who killed, # -"

b,"Yeah,"
aa,no.

sd,"I guess, uh, I can start."
sd,"I'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because --"
bh,Are you really?
+,-- our family's growing.
ny,Yeah.
sd,"Uh, so I'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have."
sd,"We've got, like, an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine Horizon."
sd,"So, # I'm looking for something, uh, littler # --"
b,"# Uh-huh,"
bf,which are both kind of small. #

aa,yeah.
sd,"Uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while"
sd,"and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans --"
b,Uh-huh.

qy,Are you looking for an American car
qrr,"or, you open to buying foreign cars?"

b,Uh-huh.

sd,I guess the American cars had a bad reputation
sd,but --
b,Uh-huh.

b,Right.

sd,"Personally, I have a Japanese car right now,"
sd,and I really like it a lot.

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, uh, you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now,"
sv,"but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while."
b,Yeah.
sd,"If I were to buy another car, I would be, uh, I would be partial to buying another Japanese car,"
sd,"but I would also look at American cars,"
sd,"but when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also"
sv,and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"I mean, e-, --"
sd,"So, if I were, -"

b,Right.

aa,it is.

sd,the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car.
sd,I would really like to have a sports car.
sd,"Uh <throat_clearing>, I don't really, I don't have a family,"
sd,"so I don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, <throat_clearing> haul people around in."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So I'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh, -"
qy^d,"Oh, like a Miata or something like that?"

%,Um.
sd,"But, uh, something along that lines."
ba,((Interesting)).
sd,"Uh, because I have a, an economy car right now, which is okay,"

b,Yeah.

ba,((That's)) interesting.

b,Right.

%,"Probably,"
b,Right.
%,"Uh,"
%,"That's, -"
sd,"when I bought the car that I bought, I was looking for mileage,"
sd,"and I was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was g-, that I would get a, for the money that I was going to spend, that I would get a return that was, that was worth that money."
b,Yeah.
%,"So, -"
b,Yeah
sd,"I c-, I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, you know, price performance and # things like that. #"
aa,"# Right,"
aa,exactly. #
+,"And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess,"
sv,"but it, you know --"
b,Yeah.

sd,"But, you know --"
aa,That's right.

sd,Actually --
b,Uh-huh.

sd,and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton.
b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.

x,<Sniffing>.

b,Okay.

sd,"Uh, I've had, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think,"
sv,"and, and they were okay."
sd,I had a Pontiac once
sd,"and, and I never had a problem with it,"
sd,"but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point"
sd,"and I, I had driven it a few times"

%,Um.
+,"-- j-, just from, -"
sd,"well, actually, I had a, uh, a Dodge Omni at one point --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car."
b,Yeah.
sv,"So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be looking for a foreign car."
ba,That's interesting.
%,"But, -"

sv,"it, it's hard to beat some of the, -"
sd,"uh, like, I guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one Corsica, uh, buy back at a, they say G M sponsored auction,"
sd,but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that --
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you, -"

b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- fourteen to sixteen is what they go for --
b,Right.

b,Yeah

sd,"we can get a, like a Caravan --"
b,Uh-huh.

b,Right.

sd,"Hey, I need the exercise,"
qh,so what the heck.
aa,<Laughter> That's right.
sd,"Well, we, um, we, my husband does the same thing,"
sd,"he does the yard,"
sd,"and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower,"
sd,but I keep putting off learning.
sv,"Hey, you've got the right idea."
aa,That's right.
sd,But I had recently gone out and planted mums.
sd,"We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago,"
sd,and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and put out yellow and bronze
sd,"and they're just gorgeous, and so then last week my mom comes in town,"
sd,"and she says Well, those are going to die just the first frost."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"She said, You should have done pansies."
sd,"And I went, Well, now you tell me."
b,Yeah <laughter>.
sd,"So the first night, that around Halloween -"
sd,"and we went out and covered them with a sheet,"
sd,and they did okay that first night.
sd,"But the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it,"
sd,so I guess I've lost them.
sd,I haven't gone out to check yet.
b,"Yeah,"
ba,I don't blame you.
sd,I wouldn't want to look at them.
aa,"No,"
ad,"listen,"
sd,"but, um, the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here."
sd,I guess it was about four years ago.
sd,"And we did not know in August to put down the, uh, whatever it is for grub worms."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And the next spring, I guess in that March, every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed, we'd have big whole patches come up."
qy,Have you ever seen it --
ny,Yeah.
+,-- what grub worms do?
ny,Yeah.
sd,"And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it,"
sd,"it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt."
sd,So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything.
sd,"It took a lot of money and a lot of time,"
sd,so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon.
b,"Yeah,"
qy,"you, you think that's what it was, huh."
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
sd,we found them --
bk,Okay.
b,-- yeah
sd,we found them.
sd,We dug under there about an inch
sd,and you could see them.
sd,"They're real fat little white things,"
sd,and --
b,Yeah.
+,-- they said they turn into black bugs in the spring --
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"those kind of brown, uh, Ju-,"
aa,"-- yeah,"
%,"but in, but in the, -"
+,What we call June bugs --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and some people call them May beetles.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"June bugs is what I'd heard them called,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"so any how, occasionally I find them in the flower beds."
sd,They said that every yard has some --
b,"Uh, yeah."
sd,-- but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem.
sd,"So that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"well, I had some of that problem,"
sd,but mine was freeze.
aa,"Oh, yeah"
aa,"that too,"
qy,"two years ago, or last Christmas --"
ny,"Yeah,"
ny,yeah.
+,-- is that what you're talking about?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,I'm still --
b,"Yeah,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"-- I'm still replacing that in the back, especially, under the trees --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- uh, you know, kind of slow, and, as you say, very expensive."
b,Yeah.
sd,"I caught Wolfe with, uh, uh, one, uh, one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents,"
sd,"and, uh --"
b,"Oh, yeah."
+,-- I bought about <laughter> twenty of them.
sd,I guess you did too.
sd,It's what they've done in the spring --
%,"Uh, well, I put, you know -- -"
+,-- or the fall.
sv,"-- that was late,"
%,"that was like, -"
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"because I started to say, you can, there's different times they say it's okay to do it."
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"that was like September, I think."
b,Yeah.
sd,"And I had to water it, you know --"
b,Yeah --
ba,-- gosh.
b,-- keep it damp.
%,"Well, my, -"
sd,"out here, you know, we don't have as many trees in Plano,"
sd,"at least the area where, -"
sd,"we're over by Collin Creek Mall,"
sd,"and, but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front, like the pittosporum all died,"
sd,"and all those variegated, uh, things died."
sd,"So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly,"
sd,"and they just live,"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"they're pretty tough, uh,"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"you can, you can stand those."
sd,Pittosporum is kind of borderline here --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and usually it'll do pretty well,"
sd,"but, uh, you know, every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals --"
b,Yeah.
sd,-- and it zaps it.
%,"Well it's kind of like one of these, -"
sv,"Oh, wax leaf, wax leaf ligustrum is the same way."
aa,"Same way, -"
aa,uh-huh.
sd,"That, they, they warned me of that one finally."
sd,"And I said, You know, you need to either read Neal Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery, because lot of places that would, are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there,"
sd,and we didn't know the difference.
sd,And every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before. Like about these <laughter> mums.
b,Yeah.
b,"Okay,"
sd,"next year, I'll do pansies."
sv,"Your list is growing,"
sd,"And my backyard, we had it really nice,"
sd,"and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy,"
%,"and so, it was about, -"
sd,"I guess he's three now,"
sd,so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants --
b,"Oh, yeah,"
ba,"oh, gee."
+,-- and brought them to the front door and the back door <laughter> and laid them on the patio.
b,Um.
%,"So, it's like our backyard is just kind of like, -"
sd,"as long as he won't damage it, fine,"
sd,"and if he'll, if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds,"
%,yeah.
aa,Uh-huh.
aa,"Very much,"
%,"but, uh. -"
sd,"I had a, had a small vegetable garden that, uh, -"
b,You did.
sd,"It did pretty well,"
sd,"it's, it's like on the --"
b,Huh.
+,"-- side, the apron of the, of the parkway out behind the garage --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, uh, our, our garages come in from the back, you know, from the alley --"
sd,"So do ours,"
%,yeah.
sd,"-- and, uh, it's, it's a little piece of land over there <laughter>."
qw,What did you grow?
sd,"Well, I had, uh, tomatoes and, and, uh, uh, peppers,"
sd,"and I had,"
ba,That is amazing.
+,"I had okra,"
sd,"and by the fence I had cucumbers, which, which didn't do real well, uh --"
b,Yeah.
sd,-- they kind of came out looking like gourds.
ad,"<Laughter> Well, put them in a salad, though,"
ad,"and you say, well, I made it though, at least it's mine."
sd,"But I had squash,"
sd,"I had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
ba,Great.
sd,"Um, currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program."
b,Huh-uh.
sd,I'm mainly do a lot of walking.
sd,I have a son that's a little bit overweight
sd,"and, um, the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around."
sd,So my wife and I kind of take turns.
sd,At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program.
sd,"But, in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down."
sd,"All this space that normally would be dedicated <laughter> towards the,"
b,Yeah.
+,"exercise area, is covered in boxes."
qw,"Um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly?"
sd,"Well, I had, uh, a little routine that I did for warm ups."
b,Huh-uh.
sd,"And then I did some very mild, say, light weight lifting."
sd,"Nothing, -"
sd,"I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles,"
b,Huh-uh.
+,just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age <laughter>.
b,Yeah
sd,"<laughter>. Um, right now, um, I try when it's nice out,"
sd,"it's been raining a lot this spring,"
sd,"but I try to, uh, -"
sd,I have a bicycle
sd,and I like to cycle a lot.
sd,"And, uh, my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas,"
sd,"I don't know,"
b,Huh-uh.
+,"if it's up north,"
sd,but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
sd,"and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun."
b,Huh-uh.
sd,"Um, so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that."
sd,"And, um, T I, where I work has, uh, a fitness center"
sd,"so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill,"
sd,"and, um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on."
sd,"So I try to, -"
sd,I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis.
sd,"I used to, uh, get into it and get out of it based on my schedule,"
sd,"so I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now,"
sv,but it's a big commitment.
sd,We don't have any kids yet
sd,"so, that's a lot of, part of it."
b,Yeah.
sv,That's a plus.
sd,"Oh, I have a total of five children."
sd,I have three left living at home.
b,Huh-uh.
sd,"And they do take up a big part of my, uh, my evening and weekend."
b,Yeah.
sv,"And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too."
b,Yeah.
sv,It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.
aa,"(( Yes, ))"
sv,when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.
b,Huh-uh <laughter>.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"That's why, they, uh, really stress, at T I, they really stress, staying in shape, like stay in fit, overall fitness, you know, no smoking and all that."
sd,"But it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes"
sd,and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.
sv,"But it's really hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever."
sv,I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever.
b,Yeah.
b,Yeah.
sv,"You have to, -"
sv,what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.
b,Huh-uh.
sv,"And you can use what ever rationale you want,"
sv,"but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live."
aa,Right.
sv,"And, uh, you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then I'll around a lot longer,"
x,<Laughter>
sv,"And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it."
b,Huh-uh.
sv,"If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Um, I've been learning a lot lately about, um, -"
sd,"I've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper,"
qy^d,I don't know if you're familiar with him --
b,Huh-uh.
sd,-- he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really.
sd,"He's, he's, kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing."
sd,"Um, he was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are inactivity, * mistranscribed? listen"
sd,"and what was the other one, I think was, yeah, obesity."
sd,"If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know, cause those are risk factors,"
sd,"so anyway,"
b,Yeah.
+,it's kind of a tip.
sd,"Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years"
sd,and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.
b,Really <laughter>.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Um, the research that I've done -"
sd,and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three.
b,Huh-uh.
sd,"And, it's amazing, that, uh, you know, prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks."
b,Huh-uh.
sd,There were none prior to nineteen-hundred.
sd,"Well, in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,"
sd,"and after that we,"
x,(( )) .
+,we started having the hearts attacks
sd,"and, uh, Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE."
sd,You can usually find it in a health food store.
b,Huh-uh.
sd,"I know they had it in health food stores in Plano,"
sd,I used live in Plano.
br,Dr. Price?
sd,"Uh, Dr. Price,"
%,yeah.
sd,"And it's amazing,"
sd,"he makes the, -"
sd,"you know, it's a very small book"
sd,"and the guys very opinionated,"
sd,"um, but he makes a very good case against chlorine."
sd,There were no heart attacks before we started using it
sd,"and he points out that people in, uh, England -"
sd,"and, uh, or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,"
sd,and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.
b,Yeah.
sd,He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours.
b,Huh-uh.
+,"And, uh, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the,"
b,Yeah.
+,clogging of the arteries.
%,"And, uh, you know, he's, -"
sd,there's been a lot of reports since then.
sd,"This whole thing about, -"
sd,"first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol,"
sd,"and now they're saying what's cholesterol,"
sd,well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.
b,Huh-uh.
sd,"You know, it's amazing what he points out in that book"
sd,"and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven. And in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis."
sd,"And, E P A never published that report."
qw,And what's the name of this book again?
sd,"CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE."
sd,I'll have to remember that.
b,Yeah.
sd,That will be very interesting.
sd,My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
sd,"so, he's really interested in the heart."
b,Yeah.
sd,"And he's, in fact, he's a, well, heart, too, -"
sd,"he's, uh, he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise <laughter>."
fa,"Sorry,"
sd,he made me laugh.
%,"Um, so anyway, -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"There is, there is a lot of good information out there, uh, about health."
sv,"And a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true."
b,Yeah.
sd,"I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you,"
b,Huh-uh.
sd,"uh, but to believe some of the things, -"
sd,"you know, and I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet,"
sv,"but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe."
sd,If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol.
b,Huh-uh.
sv,"That's a real good,"
sd,"um, he talks about that."
sd,Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that.
b,Yeah.
sd,I actually eat pretty much anything that I want.
b,Huh-uh.
sd,"And I've had my cholesterol checked and, uh, a few times"
sd,"and I've never been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty,"
b,Huh-uh.
+,never.
%,"And, uh, uh, I mean, I, -"
sv,You have a good ratio of good to bad.
+,Cholesterol.
sv,"but, I mean, you know, everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing <laughter>."
sv,"You know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued."
b,Yeah.
%,"But, uh, we've, -"
sd,"I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland."
b,"Oh, really."
b,Yeah
sd,and we've had a few of the health fairs up here
sd,"and, um, you know, I've always come out aces."
ba,That's good.
sd,"You know, I'm not really that big on watching what I eat,"
sd,"but I do eat, you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber,"
b,Yeah.
+,low in fat and all that kind of stuff.
sd,"But, I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, I'm not, cholesterol, I'm not worried about it. <<Tape fades.>>"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",All right.
b,Okay.
ad,"Well, I can go ahead and start and tell you mine"
%,"and, -"
aa,Okay.
sd,We're from San Antonio
sd,"and that's where I grew up,"
%,"# Oh, #"
sd,"# So # I was used to the heat, out here right now,"
b,# Yeah. #
sd,"# Gosh, # it gets to about seventies, high seventies"
sd,and it gets very cold at night.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And Monterey it's, um, right on the coast."
sd,"And, I don't know if your familiar with California coastline, *your -> you're"
sd,"but we're we're about two hours, about a two hour drive south of San Francisco,"
bk,"Oh, okay."
sd,"And it's, uh, really nice."
sd,"It's a big area for people to come from the different, uh, countries, mostly like Japan, Germany and England."
sd,"And they usually go to Carmel and vacation on the beaches,"
sd,"so it's, it's pretty nice, uh, year round."
sd,"But, uh, cool, always cool in the evenings. And warm, warm in the Summer,"
sd,"but it's stays pretty cold even, uh, during the Winter, for as nice as it is."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, um, we usually get a fog. Uh, right about, I guess, about four o'clock"
sd,and it kind of rolls in over the coast.
sd,"And, uh, then it usually breaks back off again the next morning."
sd,"And if you go just a little bit ways in, I'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# uh, # the weather completely changes"
sd,and it gets very hot and dry
sd,and the fog never makes it that far.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But along here it's, uh, very <laughter>, very different from the Texas type weather."
qw,What's it like down there?
sd,"Well, right now we're we're having the little bit of Spring that we have."
b,"Oh, really,"
sv,well at least you've got some <laughter>.
sd,We don't have many seasons here.
sd,"It goes from Winter to Summer, usually."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,Spring usually consists of a lot of rain. Especially thunderstorms.
sd,"We've got, we had one of those blow through tonight."
ba,"Oh, well, that's good."
sd,And I think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days.
b,Uh-huh.
%,So. -
qy,"Have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree, -"
sd,"It's gotten up to, uh, ninety a couple of times."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, basically, it's been in the low seventies and eighties."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Women, that's good. For this time of year."
aa,Yeah.
sd,It's not really been too bad.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,Usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier.
b,Uh-huh.
qy,So do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,quite a bit.
b,"Oh, Uh-huh."
sd,"Well, the season is just about over for that,"
sd,"uh, in fact we drove down to Corpus last week --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, uh, there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way."
sd,"Oh, I miss that <laughter>."
sd,(( )) drove through San Antonio
sd,and I spoke to somebody else this morning from San Antonio
%,"and were, -"
%,"they had, -"
sd,and we came back.
t1,"What day was that, Sunday evening,"
sd,"and they had a big rainstorm come through there, part of the same thing we're getting now, I guess."
sd,"Oh. Oh, well that's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued."
sd,At least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas.
sd,I'm glad to hear that <laughter>.
b,Yeah.
sd,That's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy Spring.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"We had a pretty rainy Fall last year, as well."
qy,Y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you?
sd,"Um, we've had a few down here, but not anything like Kansas."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,But this is the season for that.
ba,"Oh, gosh."
sd,"They do, they do pop up occasionally,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# around # here.
b,Oh <laughter>. Yeah.
sd,I really don't miss all the heat there.
b,Yeah.
sd,I'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings
sd,so we get a bit of a relief.
b,Yeah.
sd,"I'm from here originally,"
sd,"so when it's July and August, I'm pretty well used to the,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# hundred # degree temperatures.
b,Uh-huh.
b,Yeah <laughter>.
sd,"The biggest problem with, with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil."
sd,It's that black clay soil.
qy,"Oh. Is that what Dallas is,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",# okay.
%,Yeah. #
sd,"# You know, it's # not sandy like most of the state is,"
sd,so it doesn't absorb the water real well.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"You know, once it rains a little bit, it's, it's filled up and everything else just runs off,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",# you # know. -
b,Yeah.
sd,San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come.
sd,"It's, it's a complete mess, everything floods, all the under passes."
b,Yeah.
qy^d,I didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem.
ny,Yeah.
sd,"We have it,"
sd,especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years.
sd,And there's a section in South Dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Well, we could use some rain up here."
sd,"We're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought,"
b,# Really. #
+,# up # here
sd,and they had a pretty good early Spring
sd,"and we got quite a bit of rain,"
sd,but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, so they're still talking water rationing this Summer,"
sd,"so it would seem strange because in San Antonio, -"
sd,"we had lived out, um, west of San Antonio, in Castroville,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# And # the water in (( Medina )) Lake and that area was really going down, that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing"
sd,"and I thought oh, gee I'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers"
^q,and there's no problem with water.
sd,"And then I came here and found out they were in the, you know, four year draught <laughter>."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So I said, well, gee, this is pretty much like Texas."
sd,And it pretty much is in the middle of Summer.
sd,They have rolling hills around here
sd,"but,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# um, # they turn to golden dead grass,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# for # the majority of the Summer just because there is no water to keep them green.
b,Yeah.
sd,"But, um, it's a really nice area."
sd,"It's just, it's just such a change from, uh, Texas because I had grown up with, uh, the heat,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# and # used to essentially, -"
sd,"like you said, you have the cold Winter"
sd,and then you have the hot Summer Spring <laughter>.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, to come here, it's kind of the temperate weather all year round."
sd,"It's kind of like, uh, Spring, I guess, if you, year round, except,"
sd,and then in the Winter -
sd,"and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio early Winter or Fall,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# year-round. #
sd,"So it seems like we only have two Springs which is, or two seasons"
sd,and that would be Spring and Fall.
b,Yeah.
sd,We never really get any of the other ones.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But it's a really nice, uh, change of pace."
sd,I guess I'd prefer that <laughter>.
b,<Laughter> Yeah.
^2,To the heat.
sd,I really don't miss the heat.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Um, we do a lot of, you know, -"
sd,"when you do a lot of outside, like running and stuff, it's just so much easier,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# up # here
sd,and you don't have to worry about the high humidity.
b,Yeah.
qy,Does Dallas get high humidity?
qrr,Or is it pretty dry.
sd,It's pretty dry.
sd,"We get some when it's this rainy,"
sd,"but it's nothing like, I guess, San Antonio Summers,"
sd,(( it's )) nothing like Houston.
x,<<Tape is cutting out.>>
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"(( )) or East Texas, is a little more humid."
b,Yeah.
sd,"It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years,"
sd,"because I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# and # it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid, more and more humid <laughter>."
b,Uh-huh.
+,"And here it's, uh, well it's right by the ocean,"
sd,"but, um, it's not the same as Corpus."
sd,"Corpus, you get that humid salty feeling in the air."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But here, um, well the water is extremely cold, up here,"
sd,"you can lay on the beach all you want,"
sd,"but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming, you have to wear a wet suit."
b,Uh-huh.
+,"And a thick wet suit at that, because it's just extremely cold"
%,"and I, -"
sd,"for some reason, because of the cold, uh, ocean, uh, water, the air is always cool."
sd,"It's never humid or sticky or salty feeling,"
sd,so I really like that about this area.
sd,"And, uh, we just hadn't expected it,"
sd,"we were used to, what, uh, gulf coast weather was like,"
b,# Yeah. #
+,# when # we came here to Pacific coast weather.
sd,It's just completely different
sd,and it's much nicer.
b,Yeah.
bf,"Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference,"
aa,Uh-huh.
sd,It does
sd,and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region.
%,"But you, um, -"
sd,but we like it
sd,so it's a nice change.
sd,So we'll be here a couple of years
sd,"and we thought well, we'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like."
ba,That's nice.
sd,So it's been good.
sd,"Well, my wife's originally from Virginia"
sd,and we lived there for about nine months
sd,and that was a real change for me.
ba,"Oh, I imagine."
qy,"Virginia, I imagine, gets real humid, doesn't it?"
sd,"Um, parts do."
sd,"We, we're over in the western edge in the mountains."
b,Oh.
sd,"And, they have, of course, some pretty severe storms, Winter storms, snow and that type of thing."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But they're so good about clearing the roads, that, you know, it doesn't usually bother you very much."
b,Uh-huh.
b,Yeah <laughter>.
bf,Not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still.
aa,Yeah.
sd,"Their Springs and Summers are pretty mild, too."
sd,"It never gets real, real hot."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,I'll have to try that out because I had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, I've just never really been in that region of the country"
sd,and I guess I'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like.
sd,Because a lot of people that are from that North Carolina region really like it.
sd,"And, uh, they get the snow,"
sd,but they said it doesn't really get messy
sd,and it doesn't really hang around that long.
b,Yeah.
sd,"So, they, the people I know that are from there, uh, they always miss it"
sd,and they want to go back <laughter>.
sd,Nothing seems quite as good.
%,"But, anyway. Well, -"
sd,"Well, as we were talking the weather came on"
sd,"and there's a flash flood watch and,"
ba,"# Oh, gee-whiz. #"
+,# more rain # for the next three or four days.
ba,"Oh, gosh."
sd,"Well, I hope it moves up this way,"
sv,but I'm sure it won't <laughter>.
b,Yeah.
sd,Maybe we can send you some <laughter>.
b,<Laughter> Yeah.
sd,Because we could sure use it.
qy,"Well, you think that takes care of the time and, -"
na,I think that will do it.
aa,Okay.
fc,"Well, I sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and, uh, -"
fc,"Well, I enjoyed talking with you Lisa,"
fc,Yeah.
fc,Good luck to you.
fc,Uh-huh.
fc,"You, too."
fc,Okay.
fc,We'll see you.
fc,Bye.
fc,Bye.
qy,"So you like to fish, huh?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I like to,"
sd,"I don't have a boat,"
sd,but I like to fish
sd,and there's a lot of lakes around here.
qy,"Uh, are there many lakes up there?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me.
sd,"We actu-, uh, we have the, those little, the, the, the Great Lakes, you know,"
%,"Grea-, -"
sd,"uh, <breathing> Lake Ontario is right near here."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Plus, we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York"
sd,where there're lots of small lakes everywhere
sd,"and these are, uh, real good, uh, for, like, you know, bass fishing and so forth."
qy^d,They have mostly small mouth in them
%,"or, -"
nn,"No,"
sd,"we have a, qui-, actually quite a lot of variety."
%,"There's, uh, there's, -"
sd,"we have large mouth, small mouth, uh, sort of musky, pike, stuff like that."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"You know, all sorts of fun stuff like that."
sd,"Uh, we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year."
b,"Oh, yeah,"
ba,"that's right,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,"So it's, it's, that's, a lot of fun."
b,Uh-huh.
qo,How about you?
qw,"Do you like, what do you like to go for?"
%,"Oh, it's, it's, uh, -"
sd,"I fish for bass,"
sd,"but I hardly ever catch one,"
sd,"but, uh, uh, they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon --"
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- and, uh, you know, they wash, when they open up the dam and let out water, they wash down the fish"
sd,"and, uh, you catch that white bass and crappie out of there."
b,Um.
sd,Every once in a while there'll be striped bass.
sd,"We have, uh, some friends who live on the lake --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- and, it, the lake it just seems, is, is completely filled with bass to the point where, you know, normally you go, y-, y-, go fishing for bass, you get a lot of sunfish, or, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff. *listen"
sd,"But in this particular lake, we went out with some friends, once"
sd,"and we just, every time you tossed the line in, you pull up a five, six, seven inch minimum bass"
sd,"and usually you pull up, you know, <breathing> thirteen to fourteen inch bass."
ba,Wow.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"it's a real, it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just, we pull up, you know, bass after bass"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"probably during, during perch season the perch will run in very large schools,"
sd,"so what they'll do is j-, -"
sd,"you'll, you'll be sort of boating around,"
sd,"these people own a little row boat,"
sd,and they'll be boating around
sd,"and they'll hit a, they'll hit a school of perches in the middle --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and when they do, you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at, -"
sd,"they, they just drop it in."
sd,They can't pull it in fast enough.
qw,"What do you, what do you catch perch on?"
%,"Uh, I, they actually, they, -"
sd,"according to them, you can catch, when the perch are running, you can catch them on just about anything."
b,Huh.
sd,"They tend to use, I guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes,"
sd,"but, you know, I've, -"
sd,"she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything, you know."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"They'll, -"
sd,"corn or salami or bread or anything,"
sd,"they'll, they'll, they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded, these large schools."
b,"Yeah,"
%,"it's, -"
sd,"sometimes I use corn,"
sd,"but, uh, uh, some fish steal it off the hook sometimes."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,it's a big problem.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"uh, the other day I was fishing with bread, uh,"
sd,there's a college across the street --
b,Yeah.
%,"-- and they, -"
sd,"it's, it's full of carp and, uh, I caught a carp on a, about, what size is that, uh, I think it was a number two treble hook,"
b,# Um. #
sd,"# and # it's huge,"
sd,"its, its mouth was full of hooks."
ba,Wow.
sd,So he was in a bad way.
%,"But, uh, it's, -"
sd,he was fast.
%,"He, -"
qy,A big one?
ny,Yeah.
sd,"Well, it's, uh, it was sixteen inches long."
ba,"Wow, that's, that's, that's a nice size carp."
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I think it was about a pound and a half, you know,"
sv,but all they're good for is the fight.
sv,"Boy they d-, they really don't want to come out of the water"
sd,"they,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"they zip through the water, you know,"
sd,"you're, how your line goes, you know -- -"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and I thought, you know, that, uh, I wasn't going to be able to get it in, because, uh, the one I hooked just about ten minutes before, when I tried to raise it out of the water, it fell off,"
sd,so it wasn't hooked very well.
sd,"But, you know, I got it that far,"
%,"I figured that, uh, -"
bf,"# That, that, that counts. #"
aa,"# Yeah,"
sd,that's what I # said.
sd,That's what I told the guy.
sd,The guy was standing there
sd,and he laughed when it fell off
sd,"and I said, that's a quick release, right there."
qy,"<Laughter> Do you, do you, do you actually like the taste of f-,"
qy,"do you, like, eat the fish that you catch"
qy,or are you more of a sport fisherman?
sd,"Uh, catfish, yeah."
sd,"But, uh, I haven't eaten anything else, you know."
%,"Uh, there's some, uh, -"
sd,my dad has a farm
%,"and there's, -"
sd,he has two ponds up there
sd,"and my uncle has a, a pond upstream"
sd,and there's a lot of crappie in there now.
sd,"But, uh, I think he's the only one that's, that's caught enough crappie or, a big enough crappie to eat."
sd,"But the catfish, there's, you know, there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and, # that,"
ny,yeah. #
b,"# Right,"
%,"so # you can just, oh, -"
sd,because I don't actually like fish.
%,"It's sort of, -"
sd,"so when I fish, it's more for sport than anything else."
b,"Yeah,"
%,"and if, you know, -"
sv,"when you, when you have to look in their eyes and, you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish --"
aa,Right.
+,"-- you know, because you have to sever their spinal cord."
sv,"And, and, and, and, and be careful you don't get stung."
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,I know it.
qy,"Have you ever tried, uh, deep sea fishing?"
ng,"Uh, not yet."
sd,"My brother went off the coast of Maine, uh,"
%,"when the, -"
h,"I don't know,"
%,"what they, -"
%,mackerel -- -
b,Yeah.
qy,-- that school up there? - *listen--is there overlap?
%,It's -
sd,"he, he said that it was just like that."
sd,"They were throwing like, uh, uh, hell benders or, uh, uh, some other kind of treble hook lure"
sd,"and, and, uh, each time they bring them in they'd have at least one,"
sd,"sometimes they've had two on, you know, one on every hook."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"we, I was out in Florida with a friend a while ago"
sd,"and we would go and just, uh, drop two, you know, a, a two or three rig, two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat."
sd,We just dropped it down there
sd,"and, the captain had, you know, some kind of sonar in the boat --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish
sd,"and you just drop it in and <breathing> and it just, -"
sd,"you, you get one or two at a shot, you know"
sv,"and,"
b,Yeah.
+,"It's a good deal, too."
sd,"It was, it was a, like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat."
ba,Wow.
sd,"You know, and, and, and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,down here it's like two hundred dollars a day.
%,"Well, this is, -"
%,"yeah,"
sd,"this, this, this was for a, you know, large, -"
sd,there were --
bf,A group party.
+,-- maybe thirty of us on the boat.
sd,"We, we weren't all related, just, you know, thirty people off the shop in the boat there."
b,Yeah.
sd,"If you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day."
b,Yeah.
sd,"But this is great, because it was, I think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"You know,"
sd,"so you'd get to go out there for, five-, for, for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and, <breathing> and fish all day."
sv,It's really nice <<pause>>.
sv,It's real enjoyable.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Well, I, I don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not."
sv,"I think we're probably close, though."
aa,Yeah.
fc,It's nice talking to you.
fc,"Nice talking to you, too."
fc,Good luck with fishing this season.
fc,Good luck.
fc,Bye-bye.
fc,Bye-bye.
sd,I'm actually at work.
b,"Oh, o-, <laughter>. -"
%,"I-, -"
sd,"I'm in facilities and happen to have, uh, weekend duty here."
bk,"Oh, okay."
qw,What building do you work in?
sd,I'm in the South Building.
bk,"Oh, okay."
bk,Okay.
sd,"We, we pull mostly evenings."
sd,"We are having, -"
sd,"there's three of us, uh, facilities' managers are covering the off shifts. Just to have somebody here, uh, from management to, uh, see if they need anything."
bk,"Oh, okay."
bk,Okay.
%,"Oh, the, -"
qw,how many calls have you made?
sd,I've only made a few.
bk,Okay.
%,"Um,"
sd,"I'm, uh, getting close to twenty."
%,"This is the, -"
sd,"yeah, hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one,"
sd,but I don't really have a lot in this one.
sd,Usually I can talk for hours on most of the subjects (( they pick )) .
x,<Laughter>.
ad,"Go ahead, you first <laughter>."
aa,"Okay,"
sd,our topic for today is invasion of privacy.
sd,"So, I got a good one."
b,"Okay,"
ba,good.
sd,"When the phone rings and you've got a recording, and this always happens like around five or six o'clock,"
b,"# Okay, yeah. #"
+,# at night. # It rings and you get this recording
sd,and then it won't go away
sd,"and any, any of the type of solicitation that, where they call all the time, you know."
sd,"There are evenings especially Friday nights, Thursday and Friday nights."
sd,"Well, we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night."
sd,"More people call, that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall, you know, your sitting down to eat and the phone rings"
sd,"and,"
aa,# Right. #
+,"# it's # like, I don't want anything, thank you very much <laughter>."
aa,"Yeah,"
%,"I, -"
sd,"the worst one, I guess, is like you, when it's a recording. I thin-, I don't mind so much someone calls"
sd,"and it's a, and it's a salesperson, at least you can chat or whatever and say, okay, now, we want to go <noise>,"
sd,"and then when, when they actually start off with a, a computer,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# and # expect you to talk to a computer, uh, that's where I draw the lin-, I just hang up immediately, you know."
aa,Uh-huh.
aa,"Oh, yeah."
^h,"Uh, shut my other radio off here <noise>."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"that's, that's real irritating to me."
sd,"Uh, I guess they get their name-, -"
sd,"I'm, I'm amazed the (( )) question about that the, -"
sd,my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine
sd,"and I have one too,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,"# and # they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,"
bf,They can leave their whole spiel on it.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"they, they can erase all your others, you know, because if you have, -"
sd,"I think that's the way it is, no, mine, I guess, if it's full, it will not take it, I'm not sure."
sd,"But they can certainly, uh, block your answering machine so someone else calls you, uh, and your answering machine is full, you know,"
b,# Huh. #
+,# it # won't erase.
b,Yeah
%,"I, -"
aa,But your right. *your -> you're
sv,That was a good one.
aa,"<Laughter> yeah,"
sd,"that's, that's a high irritant for me."
sd,Drives me crazy.
sd,And it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times (( these )) computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And so it really, really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not, you know, you have a unlisted number or not."
sd,"And they pass around, uh, cards that have everybody's name on it."
sd,"Like if you order something through a mail order catalog,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# you # know, then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in. And a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list,"
sd,"or they sell their catalog list of people,"
b,# Yeah. #
+,# to # different companies and everything.
sd,"but it's, uh, annoyance for me in the office with, uh, speaker phones."
%,"You know, I, -"
%,"the-, -"
sv,they're great for an office
sd,"but this one guy next to me, who's not here just so I could talk about him,"
x,# <Laughter>. #
+,"# he # uses his speaker phone all the time,"
sd,and it carries over
sd,"and so not only would you hear, -"
sv,"it seems to me that you talk longer from wh-, you kind of yell into it."
aa,Right.
aa,Right.
sd,"Uh, and so he yells into it,"
sd,"and you hear the other person too,"
sd,so it's kind of a double annoyance.
sd,"He actually, uh, ruins my privacy you might say because the, the T I offices are so open anyway."
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"Uh, that I'm amazed that, the fact that I'm about ready to say something, uh, if he's (( even thought of )) that that's a real uncourteous thing, an, an invasion of everyone else's time and, and concentration to just be loud."
sd,"I don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and, and annoying, you know."
sd,"Uh, that's,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# perhaps # not quite an invasion of privacy
sv,"but I think it is,"
%,"and yo-, -"
sd,we both picked phone items there.
aa,"Oh, yeah."
aa,"Oh, yeah."
^h,"Let's see, I'm trying to think."
qy,"Oh, have you heard that, that, I'm trying to think of what company it was, there was a company that was going to, uh, be giving out information about your financial status."
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
x,# <Laughter>. #
sd,"# I # heard something about, not that exactly,"
ad,but go ahead.
sd,"Well, um, I work in the computer science center"
sd,"and so we hear a lot about things that are, that computers are capable of doing."
b,Yeah.
sd,"And, uh, this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it."
sd,"And they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera, et cetera."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, they finally, uh, stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# because # it was such a big deal.
sd,And I wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either.
sd,"I mean, there was a lot of stuff going on about it."
sd,"Well, I, uh, heard something similar to that."
sd,"I listen to, -"
sd,"I'm a, uh, uh, talk show person."
%,"And there was, -"
b,# Okay. #
sd,"# when # I, when I do my chores up at the rad-, -"
sd,I'm a radio person I guess is what I mean.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And so I listened to, was it five seventy, which has continuous talk on the weekends,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# and # Neil Sperry and everybody, I mean, the lawyers and veterinarians and all that."
sd,"And, uh, I don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a fin-, a financial application, all that information on there is really not necessarily, -"
sd,"even a, your Social Security number, you know, they,"
b,# Huh. #
+,"# you # should just put down the basics and put N A, where you don't want to answer."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,Whether it's your personal salary or whatever.
sd,"Uh, if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down"
sd,"and I was curious as to w-, you know, what specific things you, you did have to put down."
b,Huh.
sd,"But he says Social Security, you don't need to put that down there. Which I thought was surprising."
sd,"So maybe there's something along that same line where, you know, in all these financial, uh, applications that you make out, you don't have to put all that stuff down there."
sd,"It would be nice to know what's, what was, -"
sd,"of course, of course, they could say, well, I can't give you a card,"
sd,"and you could say, fine,"
sd,"but, you know, some things will be private, you know,"
sd,but he said just put N A
sd,"and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money <laughter>, they want your card."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"But if you don't feel like putting it down, just put N A, you know."
b,Uh-huh.
ba,"Well, that's real interesting."
sd,"I know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need,"
b,"# Yeah,"
b,yeah. #
+,"# on several # things and, you know, your credit ap and th-, all, all they ever need you to do is give them permission to, to pull a credit thing on, on yourself"
sd,and there it is.
sd,That's all they really care about.
b,Yeah.
sd,They just want that credit history to see if you're a (( )) person.
sd,If you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that.
sd,"I haven't, -"
sd,"I don't have any friends down at the, the Austin plant,"
sd,"but I heard that they were really upset about the drug thing,"
sd,and we seem to up here have just breezed through that
sd,and apparently some other companies are having trouble
sd,"that, I don't have any trouble with it."
sd,"Uh, it's kind of unusual here we are in Dallas, you know, the biggest location and, and it just breezed through"
sd,"and wasn't really, no one was, I guess, was really too concerned about it, uh, yet in Austin, there, there were, whether it was a class action or how far it got, I don't really know because T I only had a few things on T I NEWS I think about it,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,# that # they were objecting to
%,"but the, -"
sd,"some people object to that which I don't mind, (( no )) problem at all, you know."
sd,"Oh, I know that there's several people I've talked to that really have a problem with it"
sd,"and,"
b,# Huh. #
+,# I'm # former military
sd,"so you get kind of used to,"
b,"# Yeah,"
b,right. #
+,# to going # through stuff like that.
sd,"You know, you don't pay any attention to it. I mean,"
b,# Right. #
sd,"# once # you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam,"
x,# <Laughter>. #
+,"# <Laughter> # (( )) , you know, you just kind of,"
aa,# I know. #
+,# kind of # blow it off
%,"but <laughter>, -"
aa,"I know, yeah."
sd,"I served my time too, yeah."
sd,"So, I think, I think the people who have, who have been down that route or have had it, to deal with anything like that have learned, you know, it's just one of those things."
sd,You just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it.
b,Yeah.
sd,But I do know that there are several (( sites )) .
%,"I didn't, -"
sd,"I wasn't aware that Austin was one of them,"
sd,but I think Johnson City was one.
qy,"Oh, did they object too?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"there's, there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue."
b,Uh-huh.
+,"And the, but also on things that I'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were people, uh, there were, the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"well, I'm, I'm all for it."
%,"I, -"
sd,"uh, it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or, you know, carry it to wherever you want to carry it really, uh,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# uh, # of course, that would really be a big thing in a public school"
sd,"but, uh, I'm saying certainly at work I have no problem with it."
sd,"Uh, uh, and I think it is, they, they found that it's been very low really."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I guess maybe at the locations though, I don't know if they have it done but, done it by location."
sv,"I don't really know if, uh, they need to publish that really."
sv,"Oh, I don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and, (( )) , on an individual basis."
aa,Right.
sv,"I mean,"
aa,# Right. #

aa,# Right. #

sv,"But I think that was an actu-, actually a good thing that happened, uh, I never considered it, I guess, it's an invasion of your privacy"
sv,"but it's something that is for the good of so many people, you know, to,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# have # everyone, uh, take the test right away"
sd,"and, uh, and hopefully, maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that, well, uh, I might as well get off, you know, if I want to stay so, you know,"
sv,"# Oh, I, #"
+,# if that # was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good.
+,"Oh, I think it's a safety factor too because, you know, when people are inebriated, whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever, they are very unsafe for the, their co-workers, you know,"
aa,"# Oh, sure. #"
+,"# it's like, # you know, my father was a fireman"
sd,"and I can just imagine if, you know, <laughter>, you know, some guy being on drugs they go there"
sd,"and,"
b,# Right. #
+,"# and, # you know, you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you"
sd,"and they fall, they fall out because of the drug issue,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sv,"but the (( )) use of drugs or anything like that,"
b,# Right. #

sd,"this is, this is a tough one, I don't, really haven't thought about any of this."

qy,"So we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh. *listen"
b^m,Drug testing in the work place.
sd,"Um. I've been tested a few times, just before pre-, drug employment."
sd,But that's about it.
sd,I've never had random drug testing.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"we have random drug testing at, in my business,"
sd,"but I've never been, uh, never had to do it."
bh,"Oh, really?"
ny,"Yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"they started that about a year ago,"
sv,"and I think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,"
%,# at least that's. # -
qy^d,"# Oh, they do with alcohol. #"
br,Pardon?
qy,They do it with alcohol?
ny,"Yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"they, they, they'll check for alcohol."
sv,"Oh, I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine."
ar,"No,"
sd,"once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing."
ba,Huh. That's interesting.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"it's a, -"
qw,What type of field of work are you in?
sd,I'm in the oil business.
b^m,"Oh, in the oil business."
aa,Yeah.
bk,"Okay,"
qy^d,and you work in the office around.
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I work in the office,"
sv,"so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment."
b,Uh-huh.
x,<Laughter>.
b,Yeah
sd,"see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags --"
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"-- for the cars,"
sd,and we work around a lot of explosives.
sv,"<Laughter> Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on."
b,"Yeah,"
%,"so that's, you know, -"
sd,"I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,"
sv,"and so they could blow up the whole, -"
sd,"well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,"
sv,"but still, it can be dangerous."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"well, I, I, I agree."
sv,"I think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff."
b,Yeah.
%,"You know,"
%,"if it's, -"
sd,"as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know, -"
sd,"as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it."
qy,"Now do they fire them, or do they? -"
^h,"Well, see, this is it,"
sd,this is where I start having my problems with my company.
sd,"I work for a private company,"
sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and the policy is something like, see if I can re-, state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired."
ba,"Oh, wow."
sv,"So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos."
%,"Huh, that's. -"
sv,"I think our policy is that, -"
sv,"all right, it's probably the same thing."
h,"I'm not really sure what the <laughter>, -"
b,"Yeah,"
b,"really,"
sv,"it's one of those things that you read once,"
sv,"and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it <laughter>."
aa,<Laughter> That's right.
sd,"But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,"
sd,but I'm not sure if --
b,Yeah.
+,-- if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.
b,"Yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,our company's a little tougher on the second chance.
sv,"I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply."
qy,"Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits, -"
no,"Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment"
%,"and, you know, it's not, -"
sd,"I guess I ha-, haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, so I gue-, you know, I guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,"
sd,"I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in"
sd,"and next week,"
x,<Laughter>.

sv,You could time it just right.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,"right,"
aa,right.
sd,"I know one employee,"
sd,"I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,"
sd,and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.
sv,That'd be just as dangerous.
aa,Yeah.
sv,"Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff."
aa,Huh. That's true.
sd,"You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case <laughter>."
b,Uh-huh.
qy,"Do they give any limits on alcohol,"
qrr,or is it? -
no,"Uh, I don't remember, to tell you the truth."
sv,I don't think they do.
sv,"Um, well, they must,"
ba,"I mean, gee whiz."
sd,"That just shows you how much I've been paying attention,"
sd,"because I, I really don't know."
x,<Laughter>.
sd,I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask <laughter>.
b,<Laughter> Oh.
sv,"Well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far."
sd,"Uh, there was a company in Houston that,"
sd,"they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of, -"
sd,"it was not only drugs, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Set.
b,Okay.
qy,"You, you got the topic, right?"
ny,Yeah.
b,Okay.
qw,"Uh, well, where in Dallas are you?"
sd,I'm in Richardson.
bk,"Oh, okay."
qy,"So you do re-, do recycling there?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"Richardson has, uh, well, they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly, if it's not raining."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And they also have a couple of areas where you can take, uh, cans, plastic and paper, to, uh, you know, dump them off there if you don't, uh, want to wait and have a pick up, least of paper,"
sd,but they don't pick up the other items.
sd,They don't pick up cans or the --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- plastic.
qy,"Are they going to later,"
qy,do you know?
no,I'm not sure.
sd,"They only started to do the newspaper <breathing>, uh, late last year."
sd,Just kind of like a trial basis.
b,Uh-huh.
+,"And see how it goes, so I don't know if they're going to pick up the other things."
%,Um.
qo,What about you?
sd,"Well, I'm, I'm in Dallas proper --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- in the city of Dallas
sd,"and I know they do have, you know, a pilot program going on"
sd,but it's not here.
%,Um.
sd,So they're not picking up anything <laughter>.
b,Oh.
sd,"So, I mean, we, we collect everything <breathing>."
sd,"We've got all these boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything."
qw,Where do you take them?
sd,"Well, there's, there's a couple places."
sd,"Unfortunately, we can't find a place that will take everything."
%,Um.
sd,"Uh, there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, uh, shopping bags --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- like most of the grocery stores.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything.
sd,I can't remember what it is they don't take.
%,Um.
sd,And the library will take glass.
sd,"So we end up, you know, -"
sd,on the weekend we pack it all in the car
sd,"and,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,"and as we go places <laughter> we, oh, wait, we can drop the glass off <laughter>, you know."
%,Um.
sd,"Drop things off one at a time,"
sd,"but, uh, and it's kind of disappointing, I mean,"
sd,"I would even be happy if they just had one, you know, one place where you could do everything."
sd,"You know, it would still be more convenient than what we have now."
sd,"One of the people from my department, I think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter."
%,Um.
sd,I think it was --
qw,Where is that?
+,-- closer to downtown.
sd,"Uh, she's not here anymore --"
b,Oh.
%,"-- but, uh, yeah,"
sd,I'm pretty far north.
sd,"I'm not, I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm north of Addison actually."
b,Oh.
sd,"So I'm, I'm really <laughter> -- -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- I'm, s-, I'm in Dallas, but only technically <laughter>."
sd,"Well, sometimes we take our, uh, we always keep our aluminum cans."
b,Uh-huh.
x,<Laughter>.
b,Yeah.
sd,And a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,I've seen those.
sd,You don't get too much money back.
sd,I figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there.
b,Yeah.
sd,"But normally I collect, oh, like three trash bags full --"
b,Yeah.
sd,-- and I take them over to that can bank
sd,"and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans <laughter>,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,in the can bank.
sd,Don't get too much money for them
%,"but, -"
sv,"Well, you get something <laughter>."
x,<Laughter>.
%,"Uh,"
b,Yeah.
sd,"We used to do that,"
sd,"but, again, that's another stop --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and it doesn't take plastic bags and, and all that sort of thing,"
sd,"but, uh, I think that, you know, I heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is"
sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- so hopefully they'll do it soon.
sd,That would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, where I grew up we only had one a week"
sd,and that was certainly sufficient.
sd,"So if they just do, -"
sd,one of them will be trash
sd,"and the alternate time would be recyclables,"
sd,that would be great.
b,Yeah.
%,"So, -"
b,Yeah.
sd,"Uh, I'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers, you know."
sd,I seem to put them out there --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- on Wednesday
sd,"and like sometimes they come by,"
sd,sometimes they don't.
b,Oh.
sd,I'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that.
%,Um.
sd,"But I could certainly have, uh, three bins out there for, you know, plastic and --"
b,Right.
+,"-- and tin and paper, whatever they were going to, uh, separate into and, and have them pick it up on, on one of the two days per week."
sd,That would be easy.
b,Yeah.
qy,"Do you have to, uh, sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that, that sort of thing"
qrr,or do they take the whole thing?
sd,"You're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there."
bk,"Oh, okay."
sd,"Uh, or you're not supposed to put magazines in there --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and you can't take newspapers.
sd,"Now at work, uh, you know, we have changed our recycling."
sd,At first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle.
sd,"And not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears, you can throw it in there because at first --"
oo_co_cc,Let me guess --
+,"-- they said, -"
sd,"-- you work at T I,"
^g,right?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"at first they said,"
sd,<Laughter> So do I.
+,"They said, no telephone books."
b,Yeah.
sv,"You know, well, that's stupid"
sd,and then they --
%,Um.
+,-- said no newspapers.
sd,"Well, in the, my department everybody gets the WALL STREET JOURNAL."
b,Yeah.
sd,There was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable.
b,Yeah.
sd,"So I thought that was pretty good to expand upon it,"
%,"say, -"
sd,"Well, and they take cans, now, too."
b,Yeah.
+,Which is great.
sd,I still put my cans in with the cans.
sd,"I mean, I don't want it with paper."
sd,Somehow that just seems weird to me <laughter>.
sd,"<Laughter> Well, our department used to collect the cans anyway for the Christmas tree project."
sd,"And,"
b,Oh.
+,"In fact we got, this past year, we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year."
ba,Ooh.
sd,And it worked out really well.
sd,"Well, we had the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,I think that's what that was called.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"She collected, she used to collect from the whole department,"
sd,but she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I wish I could remember the whole name of that place,"
sd,but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter.
b,Uh-huh.
%,"And, yeah,"
sd,"she, u-, she used to collect them from everybody in the department."
b,Yeah.
sd,She'd go up and down with her little bag <laughter> --
b,Yeah.
+,-- collecting --
b,Yeah.
+,-- from everybody.
sd,"Because we would get it, -"
sd,"Uh, I guess, uh, I've always been kind of interested in, in, space and stuff."

b,Yeah.

b,Yeah.
sd,"Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one,"
x,<Laughter>.
%,or right now -
sv,but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.
sv,"<Laughter> Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore."
aa,Right.
aa,Yeah.
sv,"Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps."
sv,"I think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that, -"
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,"I agree. Uh,"
sd,"as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there,"

b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"My daughter is, uh, a twirling champion --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and she had to perform over there and, in Turin"

sd,"and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians, even if they speak English, they do not want to let you know --"
ba,"Oh, sure."
sd,-- and they gave us all the wrong directions --
b,<Laughter> Oh.
sd,-- and there were just two of us.
sd,At the airport they put us on the wrong bus <inhaling>.

sd,We said things like spaghetti <laughter> <<Loud>>.

sd,"But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know,"

sd,and that's a never touch.
bf,"Uh, into savings."
aa,Yeah.
b,Oh.
sd,"Either savings or investment, one of the two,"
sd,but we don't ever put it in a high risk.
sd,It's just always going to be there.
ba,"Well, that's pretty good."
sv,"And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know,"
sd,"we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food --"
ba,"Boy, that's pretty good."

b,Sure.

sd,see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home --
b,"# Yeah, # --"

sd,"-- it's, it's tough here too."
sd,You have to have the contractor sign with you.

b,Yeah.
sd,"-- (( )) , where I live, that is. -"
sd,"And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that --"

ba,Wow.
sd,"You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything"
sd,"that's not the tools of your trade,"

b,Yeah.

b,Yeah.

b,"Yeah,"

b,Yeah.
qw,"Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?"

sd,Especially if you need a tune-up.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"They kept saying that the Chrys-, that's what Chryslers did, is they wore out starters."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"well, i-, i-, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key"
sd,and it starts up --
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years."
b,Right.
sd,They all take the exact same starter.
sd,They'll interchange completely.
sd,I mean completely.
sd,One starter will fit all of them.
sd,"So they've got a whole lot of torque,"
sd,"but to do that, they did it,"
sd,"use an underdrive system, -"
sd,but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- so it's got, to spin for very long,"
sd,it's kind of tough on the bushings.
b,Yeah.
sd,Usually what goes is the bushings.
b,Right.
sd,"You take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter."
sd,"But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with g-, with good enough bushings."
b,Uh-huh.
%,"So it's, you know, -"
sd,"after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up."
b,Yeah.
qw,"Anyway, what are you driving now?"

b,Yeah.

b,"Yeah,"
sd,"right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy."
b,Yeah.

b,Uh-huh.

sd,"Uh, I've been a mechanic,"
sd,"well, I worked, starting working my father's service station when I was about, uh, twelve."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So, I've been around cars a lot, but, uh, driven a lot of old Pontiacs."
sd,"My first three cars were, uh, seventy model Pontiacs. A G T O and a Bonneville and a station wagon."
sd,I had a couple of Chryslers.
sd,Had a super B for a while with a four forty in it.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,It was a lot of fun.
x,<Laughter>.
%,"But, uh, -"
sd,"Not much gas mileage, though."
h,"I don't know,"

sd,It got about seventeen.
ba,"Oh, wow."

sd,"You know, you get the four barrel all worked up"
sd,"and suddenly it, it, it drops off fast,"
sd,but --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- long as you didn't spin the tires too much or, or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it, it didn't do too bad on gas."
sd,Didn't have to work too hard to move the car around.
qy,"Now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?"
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"

b,Uh-huh.
b,"Yeah,"

sd,That's kind of like what we'd like to do.
sd,We just had a baby a couple months ago
sd,"and we've got a den,"
sd,it's more or less a spare room.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"We rarely go in there, except for to play chess."
b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.

sd,<Cough> I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean.
sd,Ours are the double pane

b,yeah.
sd,You must live in an older home too then.

sd,It just doesn't look good.
sd,"Oh, and also they're very heavy"
sd,and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier.
b,"Right,"
sd,there's one big one that has come off
sd,"and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,"

b,Um.

sd,"There is n-, there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work,"
b,# Um. #

b,# Yeah. #

sd,"and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre."
b,Yeah.
sd,And we never know where it's going to flood.
sd,We've got power surges on the west side of our house.
sd,We've got our stereo hooked up.
b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But it runs about ten minutes fast, except for about a month, for about a month the, the clock ran normal."
b,Um.
sd,"And then the power went off again,"
sd,lightning or something knocked it out
sd,and we hooked it back up
sd,and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again.
b,Um.
sd,But on the east side of the house it runs fine.

sv,your husband probably knows.
aa,"He probably knows,"

b,Uh-huh.
sd,Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain.
ba,"Oh, no."

sv,"It's getting to a point that you have to have it,"
sv,you have to have some form of health insurance.
sv,"Well, it's been interesting that we, -"
sv,"Extremely expensive, though."
aa,Yes.
sv,"So we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, uh, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And yet, I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it."
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Well, that's the thing, you know,"
sv,"uh, unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are, are paying for the people that don't have health insurance."
sv,"Which is why people are talking about <laughter>, -"
sv,we ought to just admit it perhaps --
b,Yeah.
+,-- and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair.
sv,"I don't think you, uh, -"
qy,You have health insurance?
ny,"Yes,"
sd,I do.
qy^d,Through your company?
sd,"Uh, through my company,"
ny,yes.
sd,"But I have been in a situation, uh, recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year"
sd,and my wife developed cancer.
sd,We didn't have any --
ba,"Oh, my goodness."
+,-- insurance.
sd,And it was a --
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",That's must have been hard <breathing>.
+,-- go to Parkland type situation.
qo,How was your care at Parkland?
sv,"Uh, because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good."
sd,"Uh, as it, as it turned out one of the top, uh, people, or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland."
sd,"But, yet, Parkland is not free, either."
aa,"No,"
sd,"it's not free,"
sd,"but, uh,"
qy,Is it affordable?
+,"It's, it's a situation that because I didn't have any insurance and I was on unemployment, it was paid by the county."
sv,So you did have a good experience.
ar,I had a bad experience as it turned out.
sv,"Uh, I was fortunate that there was Parkland."
qy,"Is your wife better, I hope?"
ng,"Uh, no she passed away."
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",I'm real sorry.
bd,That's all right.
b,Sure. *listen; is this a question?
bd,That happens.
sd,"It does happen,"
sv,but it's very sad.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"but in any event, uh, I'm in favor of national health."
sd,Well --
+,If I had --
+,-- so am I.
+,-- to vote for it.
sd,"<Laughter> Actually, uh, I'm a pediatrician --"
bh,"Oh, is that right?"
sd,"-- and I feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- last year.
b,Uh-huh.
+,Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most.
sd,"So, uh, I'm really quite active in trying to, uh, be proactive at least for children's issues."
sv,"It's very complex, very complicated,"
sv,"but, uh, I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids <laughter>, basic health benefits."
sd,"Well, I, when I grew up and -"
sd,"I grew up in south central Kansas, uh,"
sd,"we had, -"
sd,"and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department"
sd,"and we had x-rays every year,"
sd,"we had a dentist come to our school and, uh, check our teeth once a year at least."
sd,"Uh, we had all our flu shots taken care of, our measles, mumps, rubella and all that other stuff."
%,Um.
sd,"And, uh, when my children were growing up, we didn't have that."
sd,"We had to pay for it, which I wasn't opposed to paying for it."
sd,"I had the money to pay for it,"
sv,but I'm sure that there were people that don't.
sd,"Well, and the costs have, so much has gone up so much."
sd,"The cost of immunizations for example, uh, and just the legal <breathing>, the legal benefits, uh,"
sv,"that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera."
b,Uh-huh.
h,"So, well, I don't know,"
sv,"it's, it is interesting,"
sd,"in case you didn't know, Texas leads the nation in uninsured children."
sd,Thirty-one percent of all Texas children --
sd,Did not know that.
+,-- do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid.
sd,"So, uh, one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care."
sd,And I work in the children's Parkland system
sd,and it's pretty overwhelming to me.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, uh, it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county."
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
ad,Why don't you go ahead and start.
aa,"Okay,"
sd,"well, we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME,"
sd,"and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and it's fast reading,"
sv,"and, uh, the TIME of course, is, uh, you know, more newsworthy"
sv,"and, uh, it has more world affair type things, of course."
sd,"And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- and things like that --
b,Uh-huh.
qy,"-- and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I, well, I have, in a whi-, for a while I haven't gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because, uh, I have so much going on in my life"
sd,"that seems to be the last thing I pick up,"
sd,"so I found that I was wasting my money. As much as I enjoy them, uh, when I do subscribe"
sd,"I, I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and, uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazine --"
b,Uh-huh --
%,-- uh.
qy^d,-- you probably have smaller children --
ny,"Yes,"
ny,"yeah,"
+,-- younger children.
sd,"My children, our children are grown --"
ny,"Yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"-- and, uh, I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren <laughter>."
b,"<Laughter> Right,"
sd,"well, I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious,"
sd,so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.
sd,"Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because they, like you say, they have nice, uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been piling up on me,"
sd,"so I figured it wasn't, uh, something I needed at this point in time."
qy,"Well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?"
no,"I don't know,"
%,"I, I, well, -"
sd,my husband would love to have more.
sd,"Now he's the type who will get the, uh, INC. magazine and MONEY magazine and all the financial type magazines,"

b,"Yeah,"

sd,I know a few people leafing through them at the store -- -

sd,and I took them all --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and, uh, then, oh, I don't know what -"

b,Uh-huh.

sv,I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be --
b,Well -- -
sv,"-- even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't, -"
b,"-- yeah,"
sv,"and some of those have had what, what I consider or what -"
sv,"I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines."
sv,"They seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads."
aa,"Oh, they are."
sd,"My sister, uh, takes, uh, TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE --"
b,Uh-huh.

b,"Yeah,"

b,Yes.

b,Right <laughter>.

b,Yes.

b,Yeah.
sd,"-- and I do,"
%,"I just, -"

sd,"they're not something I, you know, take any length of time over."
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,"I have discovered that, you know, with my available time, I would rather actually read a book --"
b,Yes --

sd,-- I enjoy books a lot more --
b,Yes --
sv,-- that's true.
%,"-- and, uh. -"
%,Well --
%,"So, but. -"
sd,"-- now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to,"
sd,other than my children have gotten. -
sd,"You know, they get tons of magazines it seems --"
b,Yes <laughter>.
sd,-- they're always getting something in the mail
sd,"and, and, uh, so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper, -"
sd,"and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance,"
sd,"but I just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads,"
sv,"unless you just want to skim through while you're, -"
sd,"I, I read them when I'm at a doctor's office or, you know, waiting on something like that."
b,"Yes,"
b,"yes,"
sd,"I will read them in a doctor's office, too."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"As I said, I, I subscribe to, uh, to PEOPLE and to TIME,"

sd,"I like reading, uh, you know, the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something --"
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"-- you know,"
sd,"and, uh, but I do like the PEOPLE magazine."
sd,"It, it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young --"
b,"Oh, uh-huh."
sd,"-- and, uh, that's one, and you know, I really like that,"
sd,I enjoy that.
sd,It's quick reading --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know,"
sd,"it doesn't require <laughter> a lot of thinking,"
sd,and sometimes after I've worked all day --
b,Yeah.

b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,-- I don't want a lot of thinking <laughter>.
ba,"<Laughter> That's true,"
sv,that kind of is a good way to do it.
sd,"It, uh, you know, it's, it's much more relaxing."
sd,"Sometimes when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real depressed over the situation of the world <laughter>,"
x,<Laughter>.

b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.

b,Yeah.
qh,Who has spare time <laughter>?
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that."

b,Yeah.

b,Yeah.
sd,I understood that.
sd,"I'm, <noise> you know, I work full time"

b,Yeah.
%,"You know, hobbies, -"

b,"# Yeah, #"

sd,"Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, <noise> we did that like as a family, little ornaments and,"

sd,"I, I guess mostly as far as, as <noise> crafts go, I've done, um, <lipsmack> some needlepoint."
sd,I've done mostly cross stitching.
sd,"I used to, uh, do like, um, -"
sd,"one that I did for both kids are like, oh, <breathing> -"
sd,"they're plaques <noise> with, you know, different kind of animals"
sd,"and then you have their birth date on them,"
b,Yeah.
sd,and then you have a little picture of them

b,Uh-huh.
sd,but nothing steady.
sd,"Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,"

aa,No.

sd,"but here a lot of the <noise> country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling."
b,Yeah.
sd,"And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff"
sd,and there's just tons of stuff everywhere
sd,"and,"
b,# Yeah. #

sd,and then on weekends they go out and sell it
sd,and during the week they go back and do some more.

aa,# Right <noise>. #

sd,and they make it cheaper <noise> for us to buy <laughter>.
aa,Yeah <noise>.
aa,Definitely.
%,"So, -"
sv,"but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that"

b,Okay.
sd,"Um, painting,"
sd,interesting.
sd,"Uh, the guy called me,"
sd,"when she called me, the computer called me, I thought that they were reading my mind."

aa,No.

b,Right.
sd,and our house is not -
sd,but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap
sd,and it's just a hassle to go through it
sd,so I'm looking for the easy way out.
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,"uh, I know."
%,"Di-, -"
qy,"is easy to find pa-, uh, painters to do this for you?"
no,"It's easier to find painters,"

sd,"outside you have high peeks,"
b,Yeah.

sv,it can be a real issue.
sd,"Well, when we've painted, um, -"
sd,"right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there,"
sd,"it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front
sd,so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted.
%,"Um, but, i-, it, -"

sd,"So preparing is a real problem,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,you've got to prepare it well

b,Uh-huh.
%,"Um,"
%,"Here they, -"
sd,"some of the home builders are, -"
sd,they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money
sd,"so they put up, uh, a quarter inch Masonite, basically,"

sd,"we painted the bedroom, uh, well within the last t-, couple of months,"
ba,That's fun.
sd,"and we have, we have some more that need to be done,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"but the, the problem that we've, we've owned this house almost five years now,"
sd,"and, um, when we bought it the, um, it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired, (( ))"
sd,but the daughter was a real estate agent
sd,and she was selling it
sd,and it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house.
sd,"So she told us that the house had been, uh, professionally painted recently."
sd,"And it looked pretty good, you know, the, uh, the interior walls all basically white,"
sd,"but they obviously had been done without to much, uh, wear afterward."
sd,"The only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood-, uh, the door frames,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it.
ba,"Uh, that's not very, -"
sd,Big long strips.
sd,So what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly.
sd,And some of still has to be redone.
bf,"Oh, they just painted over varnished wood."
aa,"Yeah,"
ba,"Oh, my,"
ar,"well, no"
sd,"actually it had been, uh, it would have been, it had been a repaint job."
b,Um.
sd,"But they had not, -"
sd,either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top
sd,"or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they,"

b,Uh-huh.

sd,either that or it had not been prepared underneath
sd,"and it was greasy or something,"
b,Sure.
sd,"it comes off in strips, I mean not even little bit."
sd,"So we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off <laughter> all this time,"
ba,"Oh, no."

qy^d,"Oh, you agree with Schwartzkopf who says, uh, Drive on into Baghdad."
ny,Yeah.

b,Really.

b,Yeah.
sd,"In fact, uh, down in east Texas --"
b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.

sv,and it's really interesting.
b,Uh-huh.
ad,So tell me about where you live.
sd,"Well, um, I'm, I'm originally from Butler"
sd,and that's about an hour away from where I am now.
sd,I'm at Clairon.

b,Uh-huh.

b,"<Laughter> Um, yes"
sd,"when I lived in Texas, every year I had to drive, you know."
sd,I drove every year to the gulf
sd,"and, you know, so I could have a feast of fresh seafood --"

%,Um.
+,"You know, just, just for fresh."
sd,"I, I'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America."
b,Uh-huh.
qw,How many hours have you been from home?
qy^d,"Uh, the farthest away from home?"
ny,Yes.
sd,"Probab-, <sigh> I'd say five or six."
b,"Oh, yeah."
ny,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, now when I was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas, -"
sd,"look at your map later and see the, the town of Amarillo --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle.
sd,"To just go buy a pair of jeans, we'd drive an hour."
ba,"Oh, my <laughter>."
ba,"Oh, my Gosh."
sd,"When I was growing up,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,Now things are different
sd,"and people buy jeans in town,"
sd,"but uh, we thought nothing at all of wake up, waking up in the morning hopping into your car, grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours."
ba,"Oh, yes."
sd,"Now see for me, that's a long ways."
aa,Yeah.
ba,It is I imagine.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Even, well, like, I, I'm in like a little town right now."
sd,It's smaller than Butler
sd,"and, um, Butler, Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh."
sv,So that will give you some idea of where I'm at.
b,Okay.
sd,"And I'm about,"
b,"Okay,"
oo_co_cc,I'll look at my map later.

ba,Wow.
ba,How neat.
sd,"And, uh, I mean just this, this little town here is basically a college town."
sd,"The college, without the college here, this town would be nothing."
sd,It would be absolutely dead.
sd,Because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants
sd,"and, and in the summer when we co-, uh, -"
sd,"we come up here in the summer,"
%,"and it's, -"
sd,"I mean, there's just no one around."
qy,So are you working your way through college?
sd,"Um, well, I go home in the summer"
sd,and I work in the summer
sd,"and between what I make in the summer and student loans, that's how I go to college."
ba,"Well, how neat."
qw,What's your major?
sd,Finance.
b^m,Finance.
b,Uh-huh.
ba,"Well, that's interesting."
b,Uh-huh.
qw,"So, uh, what do you plan to do with it?"

qy^d,"Savings and loans, uh,"
nn,No <laughter>.
nn,"No,"
nn,"no,"
nn,"no,"
sd,"and I'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a, something."
sd,"I'd rather work for a company and, um, like be their financial advisor or something."
ba,"Oh, that would be great."
ba,That would be neat <breathing>.
sd,"Let's see, uh, so we're all excited in Colorado Springs."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,Apple Computer is coming to town.
b,"Oh, really."
ny,Yes.
sd,"The, uh, new employer is in the city."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So we're expecting our local economy to <breathing>,"
^2,Take a boom a little bit.
+,"Well, maybe not a boom, but, uh, at least, recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still."
qw,"Well, well what would be the unemployment rate out there?"
sd,"Uh, unemployment runs approximately six percent."
sd,See that's what it is here too.
sd,"But, now under employment I would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree.
b,Yeah.
sv,It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs.
aa,Yes.
sv,It is.
sd,I know people they are out of school for two or three years
sd,and they have a job that has nothing to do ... -
qy,So. Have you heard about Saturns?
^h,<Swallowing> <hum> <breathing> <<he seems to be out of breath>> I've heard some about Saturns.
sd,I don't know <inhaling> a lot about them.
sd,"I haven't been over, uh, to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their, uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the, I guess, the Japanese cars."
ba,"Ooh, that's great."
sd,"Actually that's kind of the type of car that I, I'm thinking about we might get."
sd,"Saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a, a Saturn dealer."
+,"This, this offshoot of G M <thumping>."
b,<Laughter> Yeah.
sv,"And, uh, supposedly, they've got great customer <sniffing> satisfaction from what things I've heard."
aa,"Um. Yeah,"
sd,I've heard a lot of people like them.
sd,"Uh, yet I don't know wh-, whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point."
%,"I'm kind of, -"
sv,"my card and, uh, desires tend to be pretty picky"
%,"and so, uh. -"
qy^d,"Well, like what?"
^h,"Well, let's see."
sd,"I li-, I like cars that are designed with, with human beings in mind,"
x,<Thumping>.
sd,and that's not just the driver and the passenger
sd,"but that's the person who's working on it,"
sd,"cause I do al-, almost all my own maintenance # and, uh # --"
b,# ((Uh-huh)). #
+,-- those types of things.
sd,"And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in, uh, finding a ca-, car anymore that's, that's fairly easy for me to work on, it's just not very eas-, it's not very, -"
sv,almost unlikely at this point.
b,Yeah.
%,"And, uh, yo-, -"
b,Yeah.
sd,I've got a sixty-five Mustang
sd,# and # --
ba,# Ooh. #
+,"-- I, and I do the work on, most of the work on that myself."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that, I just say I will never do that with the modern cars."
sv,It's not worth my time.
sv,You can't get in there.
sv,You can't do anything.
b,Yeah.
sv,And it's so complicated too.
sd,I look at it
sd,"and I say, boy, you know,"
sd,"I, I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that."
sd,<Laughter> Well I've got an eighty-three Saab.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And I find that for a normal, you know, everyday things. It's really very easy to work on"
sd,"and so, uh, you know, I'm kind of spoiled."
sd,I used to have a (( )) Chevy.
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,# With a # three fifty in it.
b,Yeah.
sd,"And, uh, I really liked working on it. Uh, cause it was pretty easy too."
sd,It was about a nineteen seventy.
sd,"So I'm kind of, uh, biased in that"
sv,"and, you know, I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore."
b,Yeah <thumping>.
sv,"And that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing I'd look at."
sv,I think another thing I'd look at is safety.
aa,Yeah.
sd,That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about.
sd,"Actually, the car, one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have # dual # --"
b,# Huh. #
+,-- side air bags.
sv,"That's a real nice car, I think."
b,Yeah <clicking>.
sd,"I've driven some, uh, Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips."
b,Uh-huh <thumping>.
+,"Uh, as rental cars."
sd,And I've always been very impressed <swallowing> with the Taurus.
sv,It's a really nice car.
sv,"I think it's very <inhaling>, it's a stylish car both inside and out."
sv,It's comfortable to drive.
sv,"Uh, reasonable performance,"
sv,"and this is out in California where, <laughter> where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore."
b,Yeah.
sd,"Uh, I've been real impressed with that."
%,"Yo-, -"
sd,"and I didn't realize that they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that # car now. #"
sd,"# Ninety,"
%,yeah. #
sd,"Or, excuse me, the ninety-twos. #"
sd,The # --
b,# Uh-huh. #
+,-- ninety-twos had dual air bags.
sd,This newest model.
sd,# You could # --
sv,"# ((Oh, I think that)), #"
+,-- get them with duals <thumping>.
+,That's excellent.
sv,"That's excellent # because, # -"
b,# Yeah. #
sd,But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars.
sd,"Actually, my, my wife and I are actually thinking, contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so."
sd,So we're # actually # --
b,# Oh. #
+,-- been looking around and thinking about things.
sd,We'd like to get like a <whistling> -
h,"oh, I don't know."
qw,What do you call it?
sd,A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,Year old ninety-two or something like that.
b,Uh-huh.
b,Sure.
%,# Those are # -- -
%,"# See if we, # -"
b,"-- yeah,"
sv,"that, that would be a good deal to go with."
sd,And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns # too. #
b,# Okay. #
sv,Because they looked really nice.
b,Uh-huh.
qw,"What do you, what do you looking for in, in those?"
qw,"What, what attracts you to the Saturns?"
sd,"Or, or, of course, we've already talked, you know, -"
sv,the Taurus is safe.
qo,"But wh-, what kind of things are you # looking for? #"
sd,"# Well, the # Saturns you can get air bags in them."
sd,I don't think you can get dual side air bags.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But one of the, the two things that <thumping> I'm really, -"
sv,"the, the I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. That doesn't have problems."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,You set down.
sd,You look at consumer reports.
sd,We've been pouring over consumer reports
sv,and you just get so depressed for the U S auto --
b,Yeah.
+,-- makers when you do that.
sd,Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
sd,"and, <talking> and the two cars that apparently are close to that. That actually have high reliability, the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And the other one is, <thumping> are the Saturns."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,So those two things.
sd,"And then, you know, <sigh> we kind of want a four door."
b,Okay <hum> <breathing>.
sd,"<Laughter> Uh, the only work I do outside the home is I am an Avon representative."
b,"Oh, okay."
sd,And I sell family products.
b,Uh-huh.
%,"And, uh, -"
qy,"Do you, -"
sd,"So I, I don't really, I don't really dress up a whole lot."
qy,Do you work outside?
arp_nd,"Well, I, I work, uh, -"
sd,I'm a C P A
sd,and I do contract work.
bk,"Oh, uh-huh."
sd,"And so, and I work with another C P A who just started his own practice --"
b,Oh.
sd,-- and I work with him a couple days a week --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and so when I go to his office or to other clients' offices, then I'll dress up --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- but otherwise it's great being at home --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- in jeans or shorts or whatever <laughter>.
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,"So that, that makes it pretty nice."
sd,It's --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- kind of weird because before I used to work, you know, full time"
sd,"and, and, uh, it seemed like I was wearing a suit every day, just about."
sv,"Well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, I think."
b,Right.
b,Yeah.
b,"Right,"
%,"and so it's, uh, -"
sd,some of my suits I haven't put on for <laughter> quite a --
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,-- while.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"So it's,"
sd,It's kind of nice to relax a little bit.
+,"It's, it's very nice."
b,Yeah.
b,"Gosh,"
sd,"Well, my, my dress up, -"
sd,I live out in the country also
sd,so --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- what I wear depends on the weather.
b,Sure.
sd,"Uh, so I really, I know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, I mostly dress, I try to dress nice, but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when I go into the home I take off my shoes --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- <Lipsmack> which I try to wear something easy to take off, you know --"
b,Right.
+,-- and put on.
sd,"And I don't too often take off my coat even,"
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
sv,"Well, I imagine that where you live, uh, you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year."
qy,Not really?
+,"-- we really only have maybe three, four months of, I'd say warm weather."
bh,"Oh, is that right?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"and the rest is, uh, gets into the cooler weather."
b,Uh-huh.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Course, they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more Florida type weather up here <laughter>,"
h,so I --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- don't know.
sd,"But for now,"
sv,So you all are waiting for that <laughter>.
+,"But for now, we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and, uh, cold weather."
b,Uh-huh.
+,And that type of thing.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Now, my daughter works all the time,"
sd,so she dresses. -
sv,"I think, you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that --"
b,Right.
+,"-- because you do have to have the appearance, a good appearance to do a good job --"
b,Right.
+,-- where you work.
b,Yeah.
sd,"Well, down here it's sunny most of the time."
b,Uh-huh.
+,"And, uh, usually warm."
sd,"I mean, we had a few cool days, uh, this month,"
sd,"but not anything, I'm sure, compared to what you've had so far."
b,"Um, uh-huh."
sd,"So, I mean people are still wearing shorts"
sd,and --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- and, uh, usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler,"
sd,so --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- you start --
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"-- you know, breaking out a coat --"
b,"Right,"
b,yeah.
+,"-- at that time,"
sd,"but, that, that lasts, you know, for a few months <laughter>."
qy,"Did you find you wore, uh, slacks when you were working full time"
qrr,or did you --
nn,No.
+,-- did they wear more dresses and skirts.
nn,"No,"
sd,never wore slacks.
b^m,No slacks.
sd,"It was, I think it was one of those things where, it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,It was one of those understood things --
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"-- that you just, you know, either wore, you know, a dress or, -"
b,Uh-huh.
qy^d,"Not even a dressy slack, a dressy suit, slack suit even --"
nn,"Not, -"

nn,"No,"
sd,"not, not with what I did. Uh,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,Most people didn't.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Sometimes, like the secretaries might --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much.
%,"And I really, you know, -"
sv,there's some nice pantsuits out
sd,and --
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.

b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
%,"<Lipsmack> But, uh, -"
sd,"I know my daughter mostly, -"
sd,I don't think she ever wears slacks --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- to work.
sd,"But I didn't know if the trend changes, you know, if, uh, -"
sv,"You know, I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional."
sd,I guess they --
b,Uh-huh.

b,Uh-huh.

sv,"Look more like a woman, huh <laughter>."
aa,Yeah
aa,<laughter>. That's right <laughter>.
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.

sd,"Well, you'll be excused because considering everything <laughter>. -"
b,"Yeah,"
sv,I think that the main issue at home --

b,Yeah.

b,Right.

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"<Inhaling> The, uh, the, uh, the role of women in combat roles during the war?"
b,"Oh, oh."
sd,"Because, I know that there, now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles."
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sv,"And the only, uh, branch in the armed fo-, services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force."

sv,There's some men out there that are more feminine than most women <laughter>.
aa,"Yeah,"

sd,and what I've noticed it's kept the cats out
sd,and I love it <laughter>.
b,"Um, yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"because they, they like to get in and fertilize things too."
qw,"But, uh, why would it be illegal?"
sd,"Well, because we have these tow-, uh, -"
sd,I live in a townhouse
sd,and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission.
b,"Oh, uh, yeah,"
b,right.
sv,"And, you know, they want, uh, privacy fences."
sv,"Well, if nobody, yeah, if nobody complains you're all right."
b,"Right,"
b,right.
sd,"Well they do walking tours too,"
%,so. -
b,Um.
sv,"But at least, because I back up to, um, a hillside where the, uh, wild animals are, I think I can probably justify it."
b,"Um, yeah,"
%,"an, -"
sv,and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway.
b,"Right,"
b,"right,"
%,"I me-, -"
sv,"You know, you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property."
b,"<Laughter> Right,"
sd,"the first year, the deer ate my garden,"
sd,and I was just astounded.
sd,"I'm going deer, right here in the city <laughter>."
b,"Yeah,"
b^m,"right here, Bambi <laughter>."
aa,<Laughter> Exactly.
ba,"Uh, gosh."
%,"And so, -"
^h,"Well, let's see,"
sd,"other than gardening which I fiddle at, -"
sd,"I'm not very good at, -"
t1,"what else do I, mostly just computer stuff."
b,Oh.
sd,I just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that.
sd,"Uh, cooking, that's not really a hobby,"
sv,it's a necessity.
x,<Laughter>.
sd,"But, but I enjoy it."
sd,I like to think that I'm a very good cook.
ba,"Oh, great."
^h,"Um, hobbies,"
sd,that's about it.
sd,"I don't have much time for hobbies, uh, between being a student and trying to run a business on the side,"
sv,you don't have a lot of time.
aa,Right
sd,that keeps you busy.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,and raising cats.
sd,<Laughter> I mean that could become a hobby.
sd,"Well, it's, it started out as a hobby actually."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, it just, it developed into sort of a business, uh, you know,"
sd,"we breed them and all that,"
sd,"but, we didn't, you know, we didn't really start it for the money,"
%,"it was just, -"
sd,they were fun to have around
sd,and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds an.
sd,"And now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them, and, you know, all this kind of stuff."
b,Uh-huh.
qw,What kind of cats are they?
sd,"Uh, I've got a, uh, a Bombay, a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian."
ba,Wow.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,the (( Himie )) is probably the sweetest one.
sd,"She's, she's just a little sweetheart."
x,<Laughter>.
%,"We, uh, -"
sd,"the, the Bombay had a litter, uh, last October"
%,"and w-, -"
sd,"I just got her back from the vet this morning, getting her spayed."
sd,Only going to breed them once.
b,"Oh, okay."
sd,"And, uh, she's not, she's not feeling too great today."
qy,"Um, is that typical, to only breed them once?"
nn,"No,"
sv,"uh, m-, most breeders are in it for the money,"
sd,"so they'll bree-, they'll breed them twice a year"
sv,"and I,"
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"I just think that it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of cruel."
sv,"You know, they just, they just breed these, they breed them before they're ready,"
sv,"uh, and,"
b,Right.
+,"you're never, you're never rea-, -"
sv,"and, and they, they do a lot of inbreeding too,"
sv,"and so you end up with, you know, kind of strange kittens."
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,And I just don't like that.
qy,"So will, you, uh, breed one of the litter, then next year?"
ng,"We're, we sold all that litter,"
b,Oh.
%,"um, we, -"
sd,"there's not that much call to, for Bombays."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Um, they're, they're registered"
sd,"but they're not, they're not, uh, they're not show cats."
b,"Oh, I see."
sd,"Uh, so all you can do is sell them as pet quality."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Uh, so what you've got is a registered pet."
sv,"And, not too many people want Bombays."
sv,They want things like Himie Persians and Turkish Vans.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Turkish Vans, if you've never seen one, I mean, you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred."
sd,"It's just, uh, medium size short hair cat."
%,"It's got, -"
sd,"he's mostly white with, uh, brown and black patches."
b,Oh.
sd,But they have nice personalities
sd,and they're very inquisitive.
sd,"Um, now the Himie, we'll probably breed her a couple of times"
sd,"and we'll, we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those."
b,Right.
sd,"It's just the stud fees are so much, though."
sd,It'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her.
sd,"We, we want to breed her with a champion,"
%,so. -
b,Right.
qy^d,Now these are long haired?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"the Persian is,"
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,and the other two are short hairs.
b,Right.
ba,"Uh, that's nice."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"she's, uh, she's sweet."
sd,"Going to have some nice kittens, I hope."
b,Uh-huh
x,<laughter>.
%,"She's, uh, she's, -"
sd,"if yo-, if you know what a Himalayan is, generally they look something like, uh, -"
sd,well they come in a lot of different colors.
sv,People don't realize it
sv,"but they're sort of like, uh, Siamese in a way."
sd,"They have the, uh, they have the gloves on the paws"
sd,"and they're, they're usually two colored."
%,"Uh, but this one is, uh, is -"
sd,"she's, pre-, predominantly, uh, black"
sd,"but she has chocolate, uh, paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters."
ba,Gee.
b,"And yeah,"
sd,"she's, she's quite attractive looking."
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sd,"Hope, hope the stud will find her attractive."
sd,<Laughter> And that she has kittens that look like her.
sd,"And, and that she has a whole bunch of kittens."
sd,"But we have to be careful,"
sd,"uh, you know, we have to get a particular color point, uh, stud."
sv,You can't just breed them with anything.
sd,"We have to get a, uh, we have to get a silver point Himie,"
sd,so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens.
b,I see.
sd,"That's, it, that's the fun part, trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with,"
sd,"can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, you know <laughter>."
sv,"<Laughter> You can't just tell them that anyway,"
%,but <laughter>. -
aa,That's right.
ba,Oh dear.
sv,"Well it really sounds like, uh, uh, a business more than a hobby."
aa,"Well actually, I mean, it, it is a business in a way,"
sd,"but it, it's a lot of fun as a hobby. Especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats."
sd,"We're, we're about to get another breed,"
sd,"we're go-, we're going to buy a (( Devon Rex )) ."
sd,"And I didn't, I don't like (( Devon Rexes )) at first."
qw,What is it.
sd,"It's a, well actually it's a mutant."
sd,"It, it comes from England and, uh, fr-, in the county of Devon."
b,Oh.
sd,And it's a mutant cat.
sd,"And they're, they're pretty expensive,"
sd,"we're going to, we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one."
sd,"Um, they're very thin,"
sd,"they're, they're, they're long and lanky and skinny."
b,Um.
sd,And they have real short hair.
sd,"It's curly, as a matter of fact."
ba,"Huh, interesting."
b,"Um, yeah,"
sd,"it, it, it's a strange looking cat."
sd,"Uh, I didn't like them at first."
sd,"They've got great big ears,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay
qy^d,<laughter> he did really decide to go?
aa,"Uh-huh,"
aa,sure
sd,"I'm familiar with it,"
sd,and it was a very difficult choice
qy,"And he, well, he must know, is he interested in law or medicine,"
qy^d,he must have a definite profession in mind.
bk,"Oh, okay,"
sd,"Medium size,"
^g,aren't they?
qy,Is he excited?
sd,"Very excited,"
ba,"Wow,"
%,"I can,"
%,"I, -"
b,Uh-huh
sd,"while they're east coast, I mean, I don't know anything about their football,"
h,but there you go.
sd,"Well, they're, they're, they're really very strong academic rather than, you know, big sports,"
b,"Yeah,"
%,"that's, -"
qw,"where, where you at?"
sd,"We're outside of, uh, Washington in Maryland."
qo,How about you?
bk,"Oh, okay,"
sd,"I'm in, uh, suburban Dallas."
b,"Uh-huh,"
qy,"do you have children in, -"
nn,"No,"
sd,"I don't,"
sd,I have a husband <laughter>.
sd,We don't have any kids yet.
b,"Okay, um,"
sv,"About all I can say is I guess about picking schools, um, I guess, uh, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea."
%,"Well, I, I, -"
sd,"one of the, the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job --"
aa,"This is true,"
sd,"-- uh, but what you can't learn, uh, on a job, is a good solid well-, well-rounded education."
aa,"Right,"
bf,"the humanities, the history, yeah,"
aa,"That's right, you know,"
sd,the Renaissance man --
aa,"Right,"
aa,"right,"
%,"no,"
%,"no,"
%,no <laughter>.
sv,"-- and, uh, and if you get that you can,"
sv,"and if you do well, you can, you can learn a job,"
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"but they, you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school --"
aa,That's exactly right.
+,"-- usually a company, it will, if it's worth it's weight, will subsidize,"
aa,That's right.
%,"And, -"
sd,So the advice we gave to them --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- was, number one, visit the colleges --"
aa,"This, this is true,"
+,-- that you're thinking about --
b,Yes.
+,"-- describe first of all, the size school that you might be interested in --"
^2,"And if you want to go away,"
^g,"right,"
^q,"-- do you want to go away,"
^q,how far from home do you want to be.
b,Right.
^q,What do you want in a college.
sd,Now my son is a national level competitive swimmer --
ba,Good.
sd,"-- so he wanted to swim in school,"
sd,but he did not want to be in a swim factory.
b,Okay.
bf,"So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, they'd, in Austin, Texas, University of Texas,"
aa,"That's right,"
sd,"that's the University of Texas at Austin, or --"
b,Right.
+,-- Stanford or something like that --
b^m,"Texas Aqua-, -"
b,"yeah,"
+,-- so he didn't even consider those.
b,"Okay,"
sd,"well that's, I think the other thing is, too, um, I know I went to a, uh, city high school in Chicago --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say, my brother and I were,"
sd,and economics was the choice --
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- um, sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school."
sd,"He is very, very strong academically,"
%,"yeah,"
%,"so, we've just, -"
sd,"but, you know, he had to look to see --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- what kind of environment he liked,"
sd,"and yet he, he did wind up having to make a choice."
sd,"He did apply to a large, you know, large group,"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"University of Penn, -"
sd,I'm originally from Pennsylvania.
sd,"Pennsyl-, University of Pennsylvania, -"
sd,It's got about nine thousand undergraduate.
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"that's strong,"
%,I mean that's --
b,"Yeah,"
+,-- you know -- -
b,Yeah.
sv,"-- and it's, it's, well, it's a little bit, I don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word I want. Um, more diverse <laughter>,"
aa,"Yes,"
sd,"and it, but it does have the under, you know, -"
sd,"that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school, so that the, uh, the college of arts and sciences is, you know, I guess about four thousand."
qy,At Williams or Pennsylvania?
qy,"At Williams, -"
sd,At Pennsylvania.
b^m,At Pennsylvania.
qw,Well how large is Williams?
sd,Williams is an undergraduate school only --
b,Right.
sd,"-- um, and it's a total of two thousand."
ba,Well that's not bad.
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is --
^2,"Which is a lot, -"
+,-- fifteen hundred --
b,Yeah.
sd,-- and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- that he liked the environment --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- but he did go on college visits,"
sd,"and he liked, -"
sv,"That's the thing to do,"
sd,"I mean, I, not having any children, my husband was an Ohio State person,"
sd,"and, uh, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand."
aa,"Yes,"
aa,yes --
sd,Combined (( )) . -
sv,"-- it's large,"
sd,"and they, both boys had decided no, that they did not want that."
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"that is too much,"
sv,"and I mean, I, um, I can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because I spent a year at Bennington in Vermont,"
%,"Oh, it's, -"
%,"so you, -"
sd,"Um, and that was, this was twenty years ago <laughter>."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Showing my age, -"
qy,And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner?
ny,Yes.
ba,"Oh my God,"
qw,"where are you from,"
ad,"well, let's not talk about that <laughter>."
aa,<Laughter> No
sd,but we've been there when (( )) whose gone up there. -
sd,"It's, um, in that area."
sd,I mean I just can't say enough about it.
sd,"Oh, it's, it (( )) -"
sd,we went
sd,"and he was, you know, impressed by the clean air"
sd,"and he, he met the students at both schools"
sd,and he liked them.
sd,"Well you know, um, my husband's an engineer and a strong (( )) , a strong liberal arts background with, uh, a graduate degree in a technical field --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- will get him much further than say like a, a strong, um, business administration degree than with another M B A --"
aa,That's it.
+,-- on top of it.
sv,"The thing is if, if a person really knows very early on --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- that they want to go --
^2,"and they usually,"
+,"-- in a technical field, than you're not, then it's probably good to go to, you know, to apply to a # school # --"
+,"# Yeah,"
sv,# # but they usually don't. #
+,"-- # with a good # technical program,"
sv,"but, uh, for, if you're going into, -"
sv,"if you know engineering is the thing if, then you've got to at least take engineering."
aa,"Right,"
sd,"but they, -"
%,no
qh,but who does.
sv,"I mean, I think,"
aa,# That's right. #
+,"# I think # all, I think the majority of people just don't know."
%,No
sd,"he looked at criteria such as location, size of school --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- uh, -"
%,No
sd,"he didn't apply to any school further,"
sd,"the furthest away was Bowdoin, in Maine which is about twelve hours."
sv,That's still pretty far though.
sv,"I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,"
b,"Yeah,"
sd,that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours
sd,and Williams is about seven.
ba,"Oh, that's not too bad."
aa,Yeah
%,"so, well, I mean he, so it wasn't, -"
%,"he, you know, -"
sd,then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train
sd,and then Bucknell in mid-state Pennsylvania.
b,"(( )) Yeah,"
sv,"he will enjoy Williams I think and (( )) is a good academic,"
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"and he will,"
sd,"and if, it came down I mean, as he, he came, -"
sd,he's been talking to them
sd,"and,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,and he came down
sd,"and one of the things that he said is, he went to Pennsylvania this weekend"
sd,and he had an absolutely marvelous time --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- he had a great time
sd,"but then he said, you know, it was such a good time that I almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun."
sv,That could very well be
sv,"and,"
sd,"and he said it almost back-, -"
sd,I think it backfired.
+,"So he's developing his, his, uh, internal instincts right now."
sv,That's good because --
%,So. -
+,"-- I mean I'm sure what he said was true, that, uh, you, -"
sd,"well actually that's one of the reasons I went to (( )) , -"
sv,"Kenyon, he we-, he made a good choice."
sd,"I went, -"
sd,"I, well (( )) I was supposed to,"
sd,"but I spent a year in Vermont, my freshman year,"
sd,"it was just too far away,"
sd,it was too different --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- uh, the level of income of lot of the students"
sd,"and their attitudes was just, um, beyond my,"
b,"# Yeah,"
b,yeah. #
+,"# um, in # terms of drugs, et cetera, which I thought was shocking."
sv,"Of course, that period too was probably difficult."
aa,"Right,"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,you're right
sd,"but then I went, -"
sd,"But I did, uh,"
sd,"my advice to him,"
b,Yeah.
+,"and my hus-, was that, uh, he had to really decide what he wanted out of college."
sd,He had to look at himself.
sd,"Uh, in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip"
sd,and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- where, especially in a Kenyon or a Williams, where you see the professors around town all the time, you skip class in the morning and they see you,"
sd,And you're going to get a little bit more input <laughter> than --
%,"That's, -"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,yeah.
+,-- discipline
%,yeah.
sd,"And a swim coach is going to be right on top of you, uh, so that,"
sd,"and he will know the professors in a small, -"
h,Well I don't know how to put this either in this way
sv,and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this
sv,"but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, I think the refinement that they get --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- I don't mean specifically (( )) or culture but just what you're saying, just a solid background --"
b,"Yeah,"
b,yeah.
+,-- because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do.
aa,"That's right,"
aa,that's right.
+,You know
%,"and, um, -"
sd,"And, um, and it's just the personal contact where if you need help -- -"
aa,That's right.
%,"-- he had, -"
sd,I told him to look to yourself.
^q,Are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says I've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred --
b,# Right (( )) . #
+,-- # that you're really # going to look him up --
b,Yeah.
^q,-- but if it's a class of fifteen --
sv,"This is very, very, -"
+,"-- and you need help, you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures --"
b,Oh.
sd,-- and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having --
^2,# They have video lectures. #
+,-- # graduate assistance teaching. #
b,Yeah.
b^m,# Video lectures. #
sd,# They have # graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups.
aa,"This is true,"
sv,"and I mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the, -"
qy,did he just make the decision today?
sd,"(( )) he made the decision, uh, I'd say, about, uh, an hour and a half ago <laughter>."
ba,How funny <laughter>.
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"I mean, that's so funny. I mean,"
sd,"and, and, in fact, he had just an hour before that two, uh, recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him --"
ba,That's funny.
sd,"-- and, uh, I mean, and he, they were really nice,"
sd,"and, but he said is, that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know,"
sd,but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better.
bf,It was easy for him to rule out.
bf,He knew what he didn't want -- -
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,yeah.
sv,"-- that's exactly, -"
%,yeah.
qy,"Now is your other, -"
sd,"I mean we're talking about what you think,"
sd,"but obviously you're experiencing it. Uh,"
x,(( )) <laughter>.
qy,"Did your other son, um, -"
sd,My other son is just as happy as a bed bug.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",A clam.
%,"He, -"
sd,"the moment he knew, he, he decided early on that Amherst was the school."
sd,He's a classical guitarist --
ba,"Oh, wonderful."
sd,"-- and he decided, he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- for classical guitar,"
sd,"but he decided he was going to go to the, um --"
^2,"The smaller and the, -"
+,"-- the smaller now, and then graduate school later."
sv,"And they'll do fine in their studies,"
sv,"and I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school,"
sd,"Well, he's really, my older boy's real happy,"
sd,"and he's minoring in English,"
sd,"and he had thought about economics,"
sd,"and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't, -"
qrr,or is this early admissions?
sd,"He's, um, he's going to be a junior."
sd,"He'll be, he's finishing his sophomore year --"
bf,"So he's,"
+,-- so he's double majoring.
+,"So he's, yeah, -"
sv,well sounds like you have two talented sons.
sd,"Well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two."
sv,"I think, and a lot of people talk about, -"
sd,"and it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on,"
sv,but I think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return --
b,Yeah.
sv,"-- and I think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll-, colleges because of that,"
sv,"and I think it's rather sad,"
sd,"Well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,"
sd,"this was our advice, too, irrespective of the cost. That somehow we would manage."
sv,You are wonderful parents <laughter>.
sd,"Well, we place a real high priority on education in our family."
b,"No,"
aa,"and I agree,"
sd,"I mean, my husband and I, -"

ba,"Oh, that's great."
sv,"The point being, and your sons will learn this from you, I'm sure, that, uh, no matter what age you are, you can learn --"

ny,"yeah,"

sd,"well, it was with all of them,"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"but it was, uh, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Because, um, <noise> oh, about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the, uh, <noise> when the twins were about three years old."
sd,"And, uh, they never, you know, I don't think they noticed I wasn't around that much."
b,Oh.
sd,"You know, with all the children around the house, it's,"
b,Right.
+,"kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around,"
x,<Laughter>.
+,very much.
sd,"<noise> Um, <smack> so, what I've tried to do, uh, now that I've, uh, fi-, -"
sd,went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, uh, so, then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty-one hours,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,a week.
sd,"So, I've tried to spend more time with, uh, the children since then."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Um, what I'm currently doing is, uh, taking a lot of time."
sd,I'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings.
sd,"Um, we just started a thing where every other week we go to, uh, movies."
sd,There's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the,"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"And, it's working out pretty well."
sd,"Um, we're spending more time together."
sd,I feel like I'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than I ever was to the two that were living there before.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Um, in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with, uh, -"
sd,I have one son who's gone

b,Huh.

sd,Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved <laughter> out of the house <laughter>.
b,Uh-huh
sd,<laughter>. It happens that way <laughter>.
sd,"And uh, so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,"
sd,"and I think it's important that we do, because, uh, <smack> I notice that, uh, when I had spent two years down in Dallas, down there they all have a, uh, a me kind of attitude."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And I noticed parents not spending time with their,"
b,Uh-huh.

sv,"I mean, it was bad enough every place else,"
sd,"but drugs is, in Texas, are extremely bad."
b,<Smack> Yeah.
sd,"And so, I think it's kind of important that I, that I, you know, nurture the relationship I have with my children now."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And I'm doing my best --
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"Well, that's all you can do."
b,Yeah.

sd,"<smack> Well, uh, <smack> we also have five children."
b,Huh.

x,<Laughter>.
sd,"So, uh, as, when they were growing up, I, probably we had a lot of similar things l-, like you had, you know, having the time."
sv,"When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones."
b,Yeah.
sd,"But, uh, we were, we're very active, of course, at church, and, uh, Boy Scouting, and Girl Scouts, Four H, uh,"

sd,And one lives in Connecticut <<tape skips on Speaker A's section>>

ba,"Wow. That's a, a big job."
aa,"Well, yeah,"
%,"it keeps, uh, well, -"
sd,"it's doing real well,"

sd,"and, you know, of course we water a little bit,"
sd,"that's just too much to water all at once,"
sd,but --
ba,"Oh, sure."

ba,"Oh, I bet it's beautiful."
aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers."
sd,We have one little flower garden --
b,Uh-huh.

sd,The rest of it is just like wild flowers --
b^m,Wild flowers.
sd,-- and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"They're about, oh, I guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand --"

b,Right.

sd,and we do miss that.
sd,"Um, if we had a chance to move, I think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified --"

sd,"well, we got asparagus,"
sd,"and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato --"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"Man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe."
ba,"Oh, oh, that sounds wonderful."
sd,We just got our last tomatoes.
ba,"Oh, I love home gro-, grown tomatos."
aa,Yeah.
sv,There's nothing like them.
sv,They just don't have the same ones in the supermarket <laughter>.
sd,"Well, these are accidental tomatos."
qw,"What does that mean, accidental tomatoes?"
sd,"Well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes,"
sd,of course you're going to lose some that way --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and the seeds go right through them.
b,I see.
sd,"And wherever they pooped, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",Okay.
sd,"Um, I guess if I had to rate it from one to ten, I guess,"
x,<Noise>.
+,I would rate it a five in the aspect that I wouldn't want everybody to have guns
sv,"and I think there should be limitations of, like semiautomatics."
sv,"Uh, things like that should not be just given out to anybody."
sv,"In fact, you know, I can't imagine <talking> anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose."
sv,"Uh,"
x,<Noise>.
+,"so I guess, you know, being that I come from a hunting family --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- <Talking> I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles, uh, things that people would use for sporting type of, uh, a, activity."
sv,Those would be fine
sd,"but when you get into a, a lot of the more complex weapons, I would say yes"
sv,we need to put restrictions on them <talking>.
aa,"<Clanging> Uh, that's pro-, I probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way I think."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Uh, I definitely think that there, some things shouldn't be limited like, like you said, rifles and --"
b,Uh-huh.

aa,"# Exactly,"
sv,"# for self-protection,"
aa,sure.

ba,# I can't imagine that.
aa,Yeah. #

b,Uh-huh.

aa,Right.

b,# Yeah. #

sv,"# The only # thing that I can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is, uh, uh, you know, going to kill a massive amount of people or, uh, somebody that's escaping, that's, uh, very dangerous --"
b,<Clanging> Uh-huh.
sv,"-- semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and, and, uh, get him down."
b,Right.
sd,"But, uh, you know, I, I think of my family."
sd,"Uh, they're very much into sporting <noise> and, uh, you know, <talking> as far as hunting and also like, uh, clay pigeons --"
b,Right.
+,-- things like that.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,So they have may have some shotguns.
sd,"They may have other type of, uh, hunting type things,"
sv,"but I figured if the, if the criminals had to take a hunting gun <laughter> out to kill somebody, more than likely, somebody would see it, you know # what I'm saying # --"
aa,"# Right,"
aa,yeah. #

sv,"Well, I think par-, uh, in that ca-, I think that cases like that it's definitely, um, I think if you're <clanging> to say okay,"

b,Right <clanging>.
b,Yeah.
sd,Because we had guns all over our house when we were kids --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and not that they were laying on the, uh, couch or anything like that --"
b,Right.
sd,"-- but, uh, I never had an interest in them,"
x,<Clanging>.
+,being in the fact that I knew that guns could kill --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns --
b,Right.
sd,-- and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy --
b,Right.
sd,"-- and, of course <talking>, we were quite young"
sd,"and we went through,"
x,<Clanging>.
+,"uh, the National Rifle, uh, Club <talking> --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and so we were taught, you know, kind of at a, a good age, ten and eleven and twelve, to sit down with a kid and say okay,"
^q,"if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun, you're going to learn how to do it correctly"
^q,and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and --

sv,"but yet have this,"

sv,they have to have a certain respect for it.
aa,Right.
sd,"Well I think, I mean we, I grew up in a family"
sd,"and, and my father had two guns --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- because he used to hunt years ago
sd,but --
b,Sure.

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But, and I knew we had the guns in the house"
sd,"and, th-, the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time <clanging> --"
b,"Sure,"
b,yeah.
sd,"-- but we, it was never, my brothers, sisters nor I never, I mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun"
sd,or let's go get the gun
sd,(( )) it was just something you knew was there --
b,Yes.
sd,"-- and th-, it was your father's"
sd,"and y-, you, that was not something you'd go and play, played with at all --"
b,Yeah.
sv,"-- and I think maybe, uh, and that's the type of, the thing that should be, # you know, stressed. #"

qw,Where have you been on a wonderful vacation?

b,Really.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,Colorado Springs is where we're from.
sd,That's where we go.
ba,<Laughter> How funny.
aa,"Yes,"
sd,my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maize land.
bh,Really?

sd,"-- that's where my fam-, my in-laws are."
sd,"Oh, we've been there."
sd,We haven't skied at Broadmoor.
sd,We went there last year at Christmas time
sd,and it was twenty-seven below.
b,Oh.
sd,So we had to cancel our ski lessons <laughter>.
b,"Uh-huh,"
sd,as of you can't even ski there anymore.
bh,Really?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,they closed it down.
qy,"Oh, just this year?"
ny,Uh-huh --
ba,"Oh, my, -"
sd,-- they don't have enough money --

sv,"So that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation, now --"
ar,Well --

+,"-- you know, well, now I don't know."
sv,Now Colorado Springs is real accessible to Lake Breckenridge --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- it's only a couple of hours away.
sv,"And, uh, so, it's, it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else."
sd,"But, you can't, can't ski up there any more."
b,No.
sd,"Oh, I'd like to go on vacation."
sd,"I c-, my husband and I want to go to Florida --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- to go to Disney World,"
sd,but we have two little ones --
b,Yes.
+,"-- that are under two right now,"
sd,so we want to wait until they're a little bit older --
b,Oh.
+,"-- to do that,"
%,"and, -"
sd,"Well, we went on a family cruise last year, on the Premier Family Cruise Line <baby>"
sd,and then we went to Disney.
sd,It was all part of the package.
b,Oh.
sd,"And on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck,"
sd,and it was really oriented toward little kids.
ba,"Well, how fun."
sd,"So the kids could eat with Chip and Dale, you know,"
sv,"and, you know --"
b,"Oh yeah,"
+,-- it was just a lot of fun.
ba,"Oh, I bet."
sd,"So then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas,"
sd,and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney.
ba,"Wow,"
ba,"well that sounds pretty,"
b,"Yes,"
sv,that was the way to travel.
+,"Yeah, that sounds pretty good."
aa,Yes.
qy^d,And it was all a big package deal --
ny,Yes.
+,-- where you just pay one price --
na,That's right.
+,-- and get everything?
na,"That's right,"
sd,"and kids are really cheaper, too."
b,Really.
sd,"We really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise,"
sd,"so they said we could either cancel, reschedule, or take whatever was available."
sd,"So we took whatever was available,"
sd,"and we left a day early, <throat_clearing>"
sd,"and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton,"
sd,"and the ship that was available, the only, uh, rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites."
ba,Wow.
sd,So we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin.
ba,Oh --
b,Yeah.
+,-- what a deal.
sd,"So then our cruise was actually extended a day,"
sd,"and our Disney was extended a day,"
sd,so we turned a seven day trip into ten --
ba,"Great,"
sd,-- and they paid for everything.
ba,"Well, that's great."
aa,Yes.
b,Oh.
sv,So that was a wonderful vacation.
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,I bet.
sd,That sounds like the way I'd want to do it <laughter> --
b,Yes.
+,-- I think.
qo,"Well, what kind of things do you like <baby> to do when you go to Colorado?"
sd,"Oh, well, we like to ski, of course,"
sd,so we spend so much time with our families --
b,Yes.
+,"-- uh, and seeing our friends,"
sd,because we moved to Texas about two years ago. So when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do --
b,Yeah.
sd,"-- so we don't, we don't get a lot of time to just vacation."
sd,"We did, um, last year, though, go to San Antonio for Memorial Day --"
b,Oh.
+,-- which was fun just to get to kind of walk around --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing.
sv,"Uh, but, <inhaling> you know, other, other than that, with, with both my kids being under two, it's real hard --"
b,Right.

%,"That would be, -"
+,"-- events that, uh --"
b,Yes.
+,"-- don't, don't require <laughter> as much,"
b,"I know,"
sd,"I think one of the places I always hit in Colorado, is that current outlet store."
b,Yeah
br,"That's what, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","you should mention that,"
sd,I just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it.
qy^d,"Oh, with the Santa Claus on the cover."
ny,Uh-huh.
b,"Yes,"

sd,I'm in the Dallas area.
sd,So am I.

sd,I'm in Garland.
sd,Uh --
b,Yeah.

sd,I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day.
b,Oh.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,so I guess they get people from all over.
aa,Yes.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"driving for Thanksgiving, that's going to be quite a drive for, -"
aa,Well it was when we left last year.
sd,"We left on the eighteenth, right before that big snow storm hit Colorado --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and we pulled in just as it hit.
ba,Wow.
qw,"So, how do you go?"
qy,"Do you go up through the Raton Pass, when you go up there?"
nn,"Uh, no,"

^h,"well, wait a minute,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"we do,"

b,"Yeah,"
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,and then we go straight up through Trinidad --
bk,Okay.
+,-- and straight up I Twenty-five from there.
bk,"Okay,"
sd,"we, uh, went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U Haul trailer,"
sd,"because we had to take our dog in the car, there was no room for luggage."
sd,"So, we went all interstate."
sd,"We went up, um, through Oklahoma City --"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"So, child care, your views."
sd,"Uh, well, we only have one child right now and another one on the way"
sd,"and right now I'm, I'm all with her during the day."
%,"I, -"
sd,"if I was looking for outside care I probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find, if I was close to home, relatives or people with it is same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as, as parents."
qw,And what religious faith?
sd,"Uh, Latter Day Saints."
ba,Oh --
sd,So --
+,"-- that's, that's good."
+,-- so that's what I would try to do.
sd,"With a teaching background I've, um, had a little bit of experience with the child day care type situations"
sd,but I've seen some good ones
sd,and I've seen some really bad ones.
qy,"Uh, they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they?"
ny,"Uh-huh,"
sv,"# And, #"
%,"# and # so, -"

aa,Right.

^2,Better situations.
aa,Yeah.

t1,"what am I trying to think of that, <<pause>> not the imagination but the creativity in, in the situation -"

aa,"Yeah,"
aa,yeah
sv,"that's, that's very well phrased."
x,<Laughter>.
qy,"Uh, so, have you ever used outside child care?"
nn,"No,"
ng,I haven't.
sd,We've had like people come in and baby-sit for an hour or two
sd,"but I've never had, um, -"
^2,Real day care.
aa,Right.
sd,"She's, she's not even a year yet,"
sd,"so,"
%,# Uh # --
+,"# we haven't # been in, you know, a lot of need yet."
sd,-- our step daughter's ten now --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma.
sd,"But, quite honestly what I believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up, the Pass of Woodland Park --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- there was, uh, ex-school teacher that, uh, did a small amount of before school and after school, you know, kindergartners, or half dayers --"
b,Uh-huh.

sd,"and they would read and play,"

%,"# seem to be, #"
+,"activities and not just, you know, stick them in a corner and say you're on your own."
aa,"Uh, yeah,"
sd,"and, uh, despite our beliefs, she was, uh, one of the more, uh, <<pause>> Charismatic Christian faiths --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- and it worked out wonderfully.
b,Yeah.
sv,"I know that, uh, that I guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that, uh, I don't know if the resources are the proper term, you know, just the, the know, knowledge of who's a available, then you could probably find some really good care."
aa,"Uh, yeah,"
sd,but I don't know that it would be state approved.
aa,That's true.
sd,You can get somebody maybe willing to baby-sit
sd,"but actual, you know, that's sometimes different, done on a different scale."
sd,"I have even considered, you know, baby-sitting myself, I have a teaching degree, and, uh, thought well, you know, I could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to,"
sd,"but I think if you take more than three children in, well, -"
sd,"that was how it was this Virginia, we've recently moved here to Texas, but in Virginia I think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed."
%,"I, -"
sd,now I don't know what the current Texas laws are
sd,"but I, but I do know that the license doesn't seem to, uh, <<pause>> guarantee quality."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel, file for it just like a business."
sd,"You may not have to prove any type of qualification for it I don't, -"
sd,"Uh, now here I believe that child care meets, by in large, certain standards for, uh, balanced food, if they provide food, cleanliness, <<pause>> and levels of supervision --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children --
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"That's, uh, kind of a minimum there that you're getting."

sd,"uh, my wife is, uh, agnostic"
sd,"and I'm, uh, a backsliding Presbyterian --"
sd,<Laughter> I like that term <laughter>.
sd,"-- and, uh, <<pause>> get, I really believe that this Charismatic care, or the Charismatic belief when emphasized on care, or semi Charismatic I might say --"
b,Uh-huh.

aa,"Yeah,"
bf,"it was a good influence for your daughter, uh."
aa,"Yes,"
aa,very --

aa,Uh-huh.
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"a little bit of love and, and attention is what most of them need."
sv,"You know, even if it's not a real educated program you can have good educational program"

^2,And not have any care.
aa,Right.

qy,Do you like them?
ny,"Yeah,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sd,I'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl.
sv,That would be really great.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"That may not ever happen,"
h,I don't know.
x,# <Breathing> <laughter>. #
sv,"# Uh, Houston # has had some wonderful talent, you know, down through the years"

b,Uh-huh.
sv,"And Warren Moon,"
ba,# That's right. #

aa,"He certainly is,"
sv,he's very good.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,He's very good.
sv,"He's one of the few, uh, Black quarterbacks that there are."
aa,That's right.
sv,"Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia, I guess last year,"
sd,but he's no longer with the team.
sv,"<<Pause>> So, you're right,"
sv,"there are very few Black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway."
b,Uh-huh.
qo,How do you think the Steelers are going to do this year.
qy,You have any idea.
no,"I don't know,"
sv,"I hope they, they do better."
%,"They, they -"
sv,during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But, uh, I think they still have a little, I think they're still such a, a young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,"
b,# Yeah. #
+,# <Throat_clearing> # that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing.
b,"Oh, yeah,"
sv,that was just such super team.
sv,"Or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again."
b,Yeah.
ba,"Well that's a tough, -"
sv,"it would be tough to do,"
sv,it really would.
b,Uh-huh.
qy^d,"They have such a super team for years, that won what, four Super Bowls?"
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,four in a row.
sd,Four in a row.
sd,I don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not.
sd,"Oh, I don't know."
b,# Yeah. #
sd,# Shooting # for one for the thumb now is what they were saying.
ba,That's right <laughter>.
%,"And, -"
sd,"But basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,"

ba,That's right.
sv,I think Mike Webster was left

b,"Uh-huh,"
b,yeah.

h,I don't know.
aa,"Yeah,"

b,"Uh-huh,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,they had such a super team.
b,Uh-huh.
qy,Have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday?
nn,"<Throat_clearing> No,"
sd,I didn't.
bk,I see.
b,Huh-uh.
sv,"There's quite a bit of activity now,"

qy,Ever been?
ny,Uh-huh.
sd,"Probably an old guy that played, probably before you were born <laughter>,"
x,<Laughter>.
sd,his name was Sam Huff.
sd,He used to play for the New York Giants.
b,Oh.
sd,"That was one of the toughest guys that I've ever seen in my life,"
b,# Really. #
+,"# as # far as, you know, dedication."
sv,He just went all out every single play.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Of course, there have been some other great ones too, Dick Butkis, and Bradshaw, you know,"
sv,there's been so many.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"ye-, -"
sd,"But if I had to pick one, I would probably pick Sam Huff, as a matter of fact."
sv,"Oh, you know, that's really funny, um,"
sd,"well, I, I come from a large family"
sd,"and, the-, there's quite a few boys"
sd,so that's kind of how I got in with the football.
sd,Either watch that or watch nothing.
b,That's right.
sd,"And, um, at one time I could name all the players on the Steelers, you know."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"And, but, even when Bradshaw was playing, I, I don't know, I, I didn't particularly care for him,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sd,# I # thought he was kind of cocky or something.
sv,"# He is,"
sv,"he is, #"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sv,"of course the-, a quarterback has a big ego."
b,"Yeah,"
b,uh-huh.
sv,"They really d-, they have to have,"
sv,they can't survive.
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sv,"They always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"Boy, he never gave up, I'll tell you."
b,Yeah
sd,"him and Franco Harris,"
sd,I really didn't care for the either two of them.

b,Uh-huh.

b,# Uh-huh. #
+,"# and, # uh, Stallworth and Swan."
b,"Uh-huh,"
aa,"absolutely,"

b,"Yeah,"

b,"Yeah,"
b,"yeah,"

+,They take such a beating.
aa,"Oh, yeah,"
sv,it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.
aa,"Absolutely,"
sd,I don't know how they do it.
sv,"It's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, I guess, because they know they're going to get hit,"
sv,"it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where."
b,Yeah.
sv,"An they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically."
aa,"Oh, absolutely."
sv,They look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem.
x,<Throat_clearing> <laughter>.
sv,"Gosh, what a beating, -"
sv,"they really do take a beating,"
sv,they really do.
b,Yeah.
qo,"Well what did you think of, um. a couple years ago for the Bears, the Refrigerator."
sv,"I think he was just probably a passing phenomena, I think <laughter>."
x,<Laughter>.
h,"I don't know,"
%,"I, I'm knowing what, you know, -"
sv,"of course, Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing his, or, you know, knowing of his temperament, I'm just surprised he ever, you know, kept the guy around,"
sv,I really am.
sv,"He's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper."
sv,"Oh, you know, and to me he does, um, oh, he's just so big and fat,"
b,# Uh-huh. #
sv,# he # doesn't even look like he's in shape.
sv,"He's just so big, no one can move him."

aa,absolutely.
sv,"There's just so much mass there, I guess they just can't, -"
h,"I don't know, you know,"
%,"I, -"
sv,"probably the guy is, you know, probably physically strong."
%,"I, you know, -"
sv,obviously not very fast.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But I guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem t-, to get out of the way."
sv,"As far as him scoring touch downs, you know, I think that was kind of weird."
x,<Laughter>.
h,"I don't know,"
sd,"Dallas has a guy, uh, his name is Nate Newton,"
sv,now he has a real weight problem too.
sv,"He fights it every single year,"
sd,"but, he manages to still keep playing,"
sv,"but,"
b,# Yeah. #
+,# he # has a terrible weight problem.
ba,Wow.
%,"They wa-, -"
sd,the coaches watch him all year long.
sd,"They, they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, you know, completely out of control."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But I guess most every team has so-, has someone like that,"
%,"I don't, -"
b,"Oh, yeah,"
sv,"there's, there are some really big guys playing in football."
sv,"Absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year."
b,Uh-huh.

b,"Yeah,"
aa,"you would, uh-huh."
b,Yeah.
%,"Um, now who, -"
qy,"would you say that you have a fav-, -"
qy,"I mean other than Dallas, would you say that you have, uh, a favorite quarterback."
sd,"I mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the, the attention, you know."
ny,"Oh, yeah,"
sd,"sure,"
sv,"well, you'd have to, uh, or I would have to say, you know, someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I re-, I, I enjoy watching him play."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,his age is about to catch up with him though.
x,<Laughter>.
sv,He's no Spring chicken anymore.
b,"# No,"
sv,but he's still performing. #
sv,"# And like you say Warren Moon's an excellent,"
sv,Warren Moon's an # excellent. -
sv,But he's very exciting to watch.
aa,"Yes he is,"
b,"# Uh-huh,"
b,sure. #
sv,"# I, I, # I enjoy watching him also."
b,"Uh-huh,"
aa,absolutely.
qo,"What about, uh, Marino?"

h,"obviously he's a very good quarterback,"
sd,"I'd, I never was, you know, too, a whole lot of, a big fan, you know."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"he may, uh-huh."
ny,Yes
sd,"he was,"
sv,I believe that's right at one point in time.
%,"Ye-, -"
sv,but he's a very young fellow.
b,Uh-huh.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast, you know."

t3,"<Talking> <<talking to someone else in the room>> Uh, probably around twelve, uh-huh."
b,"Yeah,"
h,"uh, I didn't, I don't know,"

ba,# That's right. #
+,"# you know,"

b,"Yeah,"
sv,"Miami's had some down years, too."
b,Yeah.
sv,"But they all do, I guess,"
b,Uh-huh.
b,Yeah
ba,"<laughter>. That's true,"

sv,"and with age comes,"
b,"# Yeah,"

aa,"Oh yes, # very much so. #"
+,# you know. #
^2,"Hip injuries and things like that, yeah."
b,"Right,"
b,yeah.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game."
b,"Uh-huh,"
sv,"and they're so young,"
ba,# That's right. #
sv,"# but, they're # retired, you know,"
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"I read some time, well not too long ago that the average, uh, professional career only lasts seven years."
sv,"So that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course."
b,"Oh yeah,"
sv,but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that.
sd,"But if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years, you know."
b,"<Throat_clearing> Yeah,"
sd,a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple.
%,"that's ri-, -"
sv,"Holy smokes, I didn't <noise> that doesn't seem like very long."
sv,"That's, that's a pretty short career on average."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, <door> they'll, you know, they'll do all right."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But a lot of them don't, unfortunately."
b,Yeah.
qo,"Um, what do you think of the, uh, L A Raiders,"
qy,"used to the, the Oakland? -"
ny,"Yeah,"
sv,"they, they're always branded, you know, as a bunch of outlaws"
sv,"and,"
x,# <Laughter>. #

sv,"you know perception, -"
h,I don't know.
b,# Yeah. #
sv,"# Al # Davis is, he's a kind of strange character, strange, strange looking guy."

h,I don't really know for sure.
sv,"They've had some excellent teams, though, obviously."
aa,"Yes,"
sv,they have.
sv,"I'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play,"
sv,"they keeping talk about, you know, going, -"
sv,Now then I think that -- -
b,Uh-huh.
qy,-- are you there?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,I'm here.
bk,All right.
qy,Do you have any one that has been in a nursing home?
sd,"Uh, well, only my, um, my grandmother, but for a very short time."
sd,"Um, she, uh, she was just more or less in a, in a nursing home for, uh, recovery from a broken hip --"
b,Oh.
+,-- because she could receive more medical attention.
b,Yes.
%,"But, um, that, -"
sd,"physical therapy was there and whatever,"
sd,"but I think, in visiting her there, um, it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in, uh, weren't there mentally."
sd,"Uh, she was probably the only person in the, um, whole nursing home <laughter> that, uh, still had all of her mental facilities about her."
sd,"So that was, uh, that was very disheartening."
qw,"Well, what do you think can be done about that?"
qw,"I mean, what can we do,"
b,"Oh, yeah,"
sv,"it's really hard, I guess."
sd,"I, I come from a family of, um, of, uh, take care of your elders, I guess."
sd,"Uh, my, my dad's mother is an invalid,"
sd,"and she lives with my aunt and uncle,"
sd,"and they care for her, you know, all around the clock."
sd,"Though she's not, uh, she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention, she, because of arthritis, she's just unable to get out of bed."
sd,"So, I guess, you know, there's that family commitment."
sd,"Um, I know that my parents, my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can. Um,"
%,"Well, I can remembe-, -"
sd,of course I'm --
b,Yeah.
+,-- old enough to remember when <inhaling> the family or the church took care of all of this.
b,"Right,"
b,yeah.
sd,"We did not have to call on, on someone else,"
sd,"and I feel, -"
ad,"no, you tell me how you feel about, -"
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"well probably, I think, as long as the person's able to, um, to understand what's going on around them -"
sd,"and I think, you know, my grandmother right now is still able to walk around,"
sd,"and she's still able to, uh, to do some things for herself, though she gets Meals On Wheels --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- which I think is a great thing, because, um, it saves people from having to prepare food for her, because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on, or whatever, although she does most things very well, it still makes a little bit easier for her."
aa,"Certainly d-, -"
%,Uh.
sd,"I worked with an agency in West Texas that they, it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels --"
b,Uh-huh.
sv,-- and I think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly.
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"If they didn't have to, you know, go into a kitchen -- -"
b,Right.
sd,"-- my mother expired just, just a little over a year ago,"
sd,"and we had finally, -"
sd,she didn't want to live with either my sister or me --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- but we, we got, found a retirement center for her,"
sd,and it was beautiful
sd,"and they had all these, they didn't even have nursing care there."
%,"So until, -"
sd,"as long as mother was, you know --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- mobile and --
b,Right.
+,"-- got her food, -"
sd,and she was with people with whom she enjoyed.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"that, -"
sv,"I think, you know, it's really funny,"
sd,"I have two grandmothers still alive,"
sd,and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible.
sd,She's like openly told people.
sd,"She's always been very good about knowing, -"
sd,"yes, she's eighty-nine,"
sd,"and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible, because it's her home."
b,Sure.
sd,"But when the time comes, um, she, and she can't do things"
sd,"and she has to be cared for, whatever, she would prefer, and she's actually said this, to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment, uh, probably with like a living space and a bedroom --"
ba,"Yes, sir."
+,"-- with maybe a kitchenette, so that if she, you know, if she wants to fix herself something light, she can do that,"
sd,"but if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, uh, to a room where there's a cafeteria --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and there's other people there,"
sd,and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company.
sd,Being a widow --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- I find that eating alone is one of the hardest things --
b,Yes.
+,-- I have to do.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"I have just recently retired,"
sd,and I am finding it extremely hard to adjust to.
b,Right.
sd,"So, uh, mother had the little kitchenette --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and she could do all these fine things that she just, ha-, had a microwave, had to pop --"
b,Right.
+,-- her popcorn. -
sd,Now this is wonderful.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But when it came time for a full meal, then mother was able to go with people --"
b,"Right,"
+,"-- and, and enjoy."
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"I think, I think that probably, until, until they're really invalids, uh, the elderly are invalids, I think that they should be able to interact with other people --"
aa,"Oh, I think so."
+,"-- in an environment that they choose, if they can, if the family can afford it."
%,Well. -
sd,"I mean, um, see, I know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house,"
sd,"and my parents actually said, you know, that they may have to take their end, sometime, so, because, you know, my grandma, she says who she wants to live with,"
sd,"she's pretty, you know, -"
sd,"she lets people know,"
qo,"What do you think about the, uh, Peace Corps or public service commitment?"
sd,"Uh, that's the first I've ever heard of it."
sd,"I haven't heard of it, anything too much about it."
%,"Um,"
sd,"Well, I think it was, uh, thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft"
sd,"and people said, well, they, uh, young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country,"
sv,"but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from, um, some sort of public service,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or, uh, various other things of that sort."
sv,"And it seems to me <baby> that it's, it's not a totally bad idea,"
sd,but I don't quite see how they'd make it work.
b,Uh-huh.
qh,"How would they decide who goes into, uh, building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia?"
aa,"Right,"
aa,yeah.
%,"I, -"
%,"the, -"
sd,"my first impression was, um, it would be v-, very good."
sv,"I think it would be good for people to serve,"
sd,but I don't know if it should be an option.
sv,It would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids.
sd,"And I think there are some available now where they are able to work,"
sv,"but making it a mandatory thing kind of, -"
aa,"Yeah,"
sv,"the, the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary."
b,Right.
sd,"And the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary, that it should be like a draft."
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And some people would get military service
sd,"and some people would get civilian, uh,"
+,"service, like working in hospitals."
%,"This, -"
sv,"I assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do,"
+,"when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army,"
sd,"they were allowed to do hospital service or, uh, things like that,"
%,"and if they re-, -"
sd,or farm work in World War One I remember --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- uh, reading about."
sv,"And, and I suppose that there is, uh, justification for taking everybody if you take anybody."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"But I just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them, uh, sorting them out, assigning them,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,training them would be insurmountable.
sv,"It seems like you'd have a lot more conscie-, conscientious objectors if they had that choice."
aa,"Yeah,"
aa,well <laughter> it's a possibility.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"you know, I'd, I'd much rather work in a hospital than, than to go war"
sv,and I'm sure most young men and women would.
%,"And so, uh, -"
sd,"Well, I think that in the, in the cases that, like that, uh, they had to be, uh, pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war.
sd,"It was, uh, something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life."
b,Uh-huh.
ba,"Well, that makes sense."
sv,"And then you run into, again, to, um, the bureaucracy in running it."
qh,"You know, how you going to --"
b,"Oh, yeah."
+,-- cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then --
aa,"Sure,"
sv,"and,"
%,"-- so, -"
+,"in addition to that, we have the cost because you have to pay something for,"
b,Right.
+,their room and board
sv,"and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"uh, even if it's like the Peace Corps where they don't get most of it until they come home,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"you have t-, have to pay them something."
sv,Plus the training involved.
b,"Oh, yeah."
b^m,"Yeah,"
sv,that would be expensive in most cases.
b,"Yeah,"
%,"(( Because )) , -"
sd,"Now I had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps, uh, back in the mid sixties --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization,"
sd,"but on the other hand, I'm not sure what the permanent value of it was."
sd,"I don't,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,know what we got for all the money.
sv,"We had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to, uh, what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"and to, uh, Algeria and to, uh, Southeast Asia and lots of, uh, out-of-the-way places."
sd,"But I don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went,"
b,Uh-huh.
+,in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better.
%,"Well, I know in, -"
sd,I personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,And I was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me.

b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But I don't know if I was doing it in different situation, you know, not a really religious background, if, if I would get a lot out of it."
sv,"You know, I think I did because it, you know, it emphasized that sort of thing."
sd,"You know, a lot of --"
b,Sure.

qy,Do you think that would be a good idea?
sd,"Um, well, like I say, I know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth, like teenagers to go and do, um, work in the national parks and work in, uh, neighborhoods to do, um, clean up and that sort of thing."
sd,But I don't know what organization it's under.
sd,I don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private --
sd,I don't either.

aa,"Yeah,"
sd,"out here in California,"

aa,That's true <laughter>.

"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","Okay,"
ad,you want to tell me first how you feel about --
sv,Well --
+,"-- the proposal,"
+,"-- um, I, I just think the way that things are going that, um, it would be good for young people to go ahead and have, um, dedicate themselves to at least something."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"I know, like the Mormon religion, you know, they require two years of service, uh, missionary service --"
sd,The boys --
aa,"-- right,"
sd,the boys --
sd,"-- not the girls, (( )) the boys."
b,"-- yeah,"
sv,"and, um, so, but I think it would be good for all young people --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know, to be able to, to do something like that --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- um, so that, um, you know, I don't know, I just feel it would be good for them to do that."
aa,Uh-huh.
sv,"I, I thought it would be good, too,"
sv,but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- because not all young people would have, uh, what it takes to go like that --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- because I think it takes a certain person to, to be able to do something like that,"
sv,but there's a lot of other public service things --
b,"Oh, sure."
+,-- that could be done.
b,"Oh, yeah,"
sv,"and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- um, public service things that they could do --"
b,Right.
+,"-- uh, you know, drug rehabilitation and --"
b,Right.
+,"-- and alcohol and, and just, uh, helping old people, and, um, uh, you know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else --"
b,"Yes,"
b,yeah.
sv,"-- and I think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very much any more."
b,Uh-huh.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,I think it would be that.
qy,"When they say this proposal, is this something that they're just suggesting,"
qy,"or are they actually, -"
qw,"why, why, why did they call it a proposal,"
%,"that, -"
sd,"Oh, I think they just gave it a title --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- but is this not something that's, um, in legislation or --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- in work some -- -
sd,That's what I wondered.
b,"-- yeah,"
nn,"no, no,"
sd,"it's not,"
sd,"it's just a, just a topic,"
sv,It'd be good character builder.
aa,"I think so, too."
aa,"I think so, too."
sv,"Um, because there's so many, um, kids who have, uh, you know, so much money and so much free time and, uh, nothing to do, um, and nothing to give their time to."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"Um, they don't even have a direction to give their, their time to,"
sv,so I think --
b,Right.
+,"-- it would be really good for people to, um, to be able to give their time in, in, uh, some kind of public service, uh, even in our government, you know, as, uh, aids to, uh, you know, Congress, uh, people --"
b,Uh-huh.
%,"-- so, um, yeah,"
sv,"it would be, it'd be really good --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- I think.
sd,"Well, people that are, um, have received sentences in jail, they have, uh, some of them are going out and doing, uh, they have to go out and do public service --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- activities --
b,Right.
+,"-- which to me is, is good."
aa,"Oh, yeah,"
aa,"oh yeah,"
sv,I agree with you.
sv,"This is something that, um, like you say, is it's character building --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- um, you know, learning how to, to give to others, and being less selfish"
%,"and, -"
sv,"Well, I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know, what --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- what some of the other parts of the world are like or --
b,Right.
+,-- even other parts of the neighborhood --
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,yeah.
+,"-- some of the people, how they live"
%,"or, -"
aa,"Oh, I agree with you,"
aa,"I agree with you,"
sv,"and I think, uh, young people are so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- that, uh, you know, to get a taste of what the real world is actually about --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- doing that public service would be great.
b,Uh-huh.
b,Yeah.
b,"Yeah,"
sv,"because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you can't tell them how things are --"
b,Right.
sv,-- they have to see for themselves --
b,Uh-huh.
sv,"-- now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,"
sv,I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.
b,"Oh, yeah,"
sv,"I would think so, like right after, um, high school --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know, even if it was the, the, their, um, that summer right after high school --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know, # three months, #"
sv,# Of course # they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- you know, they, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go --"
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
+,"-- and something,"
sv,"course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school --"
b,"Right,"
b,"right,"
sv,"You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school --"
b,Uh-huh.
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","-- yeah,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","but, yeah,"
sv,"you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, Well gee whiz, what do I do now --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- if they're not focused on going to college,"
sv,"and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- uh, that's, you know, setting their life goals."
sv,Kind of an in-between --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- time.
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school."
b,Uh-huh.
sv,But as for its being required <laughter> --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, we're just not, we're not based on, on that, uh --"
b,Huh-uh.
+,-- type of a system. Um.
aa,"No,"
sv,"and like I said, not, now all young people should be able to do something,"
sv,but --
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- not all certainly would be geared to, even the, the Mormon boys that go out, not all of them go,"
sv,I mean --
b,Right.
+,"-- it's disaster if they don't go,"
sv,but --
b,"Oh, right."
+,"-- but some of them are not, -"
sv,they're just not made to do that type of thing --
b,"Uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh.
sv,-- and they just aren't able to do it.
b,"Yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
b,"so, um, yeah,"
sv,it'd be good
sv,"but like I said, requiring it would be, uh, -"
sv,"Uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. I, you know, I, I really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system has been, been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law."

qo,So what do you think about it?
qo,How are we doing in recycling?
%,"Are we, -"
sv,"Well, I think we need to do more."
sd,"I mean, I know I need to do more."
sd,"They have programs around where you can reach the, uh, -"
sd,they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up.
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"But I have a hard time of being able, of separating, you know, having a place, separating my trash,"
sd,and get all the --
b,Yeah.
+,"-- cans from the paper, -"
sd,"and, you know, I just haven't gotten that dedicated yet <laughter>."
%,So. -
sd,"I do a lot of work with the boy scouts,"
sd,and we try to do a lot --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- but there's still a lot more we can do.
b,Yeah.
sd,"You know, I don't recycle my newspapers myself,"
sd,"but I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a, like a, a clothes hamper kind of thing that, you know, you lay your string in, then you put your papers in there --"
b,Uh-huh.
+,"-- tie them all up and bundle them up,"
sd,so I figured I might get me one of those --
b,Uh-huh.
+,-- because we don't always read the newspaper.
sd,"Sometimes it just sits around for a while,"
sd,and then we just chuck it.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"well, I don't, I don't get the paper every day,"
sd,"but, you know, I get it on, -"
sd,"I try to buy, you know, the early edition for the coupons, you know, the Sunday edition."
%,So. -
b,Yeah.
sd,"But, then I just, you know, bundle it up and put it on the front, you know, the front walk ev-, --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, every Monday or every other Monday, and have them pick that up,"
sd,but that's the extent of what I've done.
sd,I'd like to be able to do more.
sd,"The problem is, with a lot of it is, you have to go, you know, it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it, you know --"
b,Yeah
%,"see, and, -"
sd,-- it's not always convenient to do it.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"see, and here in Lubbock everything's so close."
sd,I can imagine what it's like up there.
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"I'm not exactly sure where the, you know, the can thing is,"
sd,"but, you know, sometimes it's just so, -"
sd,"seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have --"
b,Yeah.
+,-- them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them.
sd,"See, I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago, as a matter of fact, and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall --"
b,Uh-huh.
sd,"-- and then I put me a little five gallon bucket,"
sd,and it's just outside the garage door --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket.
qy,Do those can crushers work good?
ny,"Yeah,"
sd,"I got one from Payless Cashways,"
sd,and it's actually metal --
b,Uh-huh.
sd,-- it's not plastic.
sd,I didn't want to buy a plastic one.
aa,Yeah
sv,because those things I think would just snap --
b,Yeah.
+,-- you know.
sd,But Payless Cashways has them
sd,"and they're metal,"
sd,"and I don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there,"
sd,"but it was only like seven dollars, not too bad."
b,Oh.
sd,"I'd have to check into something like that, because, I mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know,"
sd,"but, um --"
b,Yeah.
+,"-- you know, occasionally we have some around,"
qy,"but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they."
ny,"Yeah,"
%,"I don't, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"I don't think it would crush steel cans,"
sd,it's pretty tough.
b,"Yeah,"
h,"so. I don't know,"
sd,"I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that,"
sd,"but,"
b,"No,"
sv,"you could probably just, you know, -"
+,"I need to look into it more,"
%,"you know, it's, you know, it, -"
sd,"sometimes, even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you know,"
sd,they won't take --
b,Yeah --

sd,"-- they won't, yeah, they won't take any lint free paper"
sd,"or, see, I work at T I."
b,"Yeah,"
sd,"so does my husband,"

sd,We do a lot of recycling out there.
b,Uh-huh.

b,"Yeah,"
