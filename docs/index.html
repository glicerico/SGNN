<h2 id="Implementation-of-the-SGNN-paper-for-speech-act-classification.">Implementation of the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1402.pdf">SGNN paper</a> for speech act classification.<a class="anchor-link" href="#Implementation-of-the-SGNN-paper-for-speech-act-classification."> </a></h2><p>This repository is inspired by Guillaume Chevalier's <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/SGNN-Self-Governing-Neural-Networks-Projection-Layer">implementation</a>, as well as his <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/SGNN-Self-Governing-Neural-Networks-Projection-Layer/issues/1">discussion</a> with <a href="https://github.com/thinline">Sava Kalbachou</a>.
This version implements some things differently from Guillaume's code, in an attempt to resemble the paper more, and extends beyond the projection layer all the way to a fully trainable network.</p>
<p>The network is trained to classify the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97/">SwDA corpus</a> utterances according to their speech act. The corpus was was pre-processed using Cristopher Pott's <a href="https://github.com/cgpotts/swda/">project</a> related to it. To follow Lee &amp; Dernoncourt SwDA data split, as in the SGNN paper, we added <a href="https://github.com/glicerico/swda/blob/data_split/create_sets.py">adequate functionality</a> in our <a href="https://github.com/glicerico/swda/tree/data_split">branch</a> of that repo. The pre-processed data is included in the <code>data</code> folder for repeateability.</p>

<p>The original SGNN paper reports a SwDA accuracy of 83.1.
With this implementation, I have only managed to achieve a maximum accuracy of 71.3; if you achieve a better score, please share your settings in an issue :)</p>

<h2 id="How-to-use">How to use<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-to-use"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><p>Install all dependencies; use <code>environment.yml</code> file as reference.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the <code>00_core.ipynb</code> notebook and modify <code>REPO_PATH = "&lt;PATH-TO-SGNN-REPO&gt;"</code> in the last cell. Modify any parameters you want to tweak from the network, then run the whole notebook.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can use <code>core.py</code> from the terminal or a Python IDE.</p>
